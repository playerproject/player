/** Calculates the 2d uncertainty ellipsis parameters for a given hypothesis
 *
 *  This function can be used to calculate the parameters for an uncertainty 
 *  ellipsis to a given, two dimensional gaussian distribution. The function
 *  only requires the values of a two dimensional covariance matrix, however
 *  to it makes sense (semantically) to use the player_localize_hypoth_t
 *  structure as parameter instead of a plain array.
 * 
 *  The unccertainty ellipsis derived from the hypothesis is a projection
 *  of the 3-dimensional (x,y,angle) ellipsoid into a 2-dimensional ellipsis
 *  (x,y), ignoring variance and covariances related to the angle.
 * 
 *  The probability that is to be covered by the ellipsis (i.e. the scale) 
 *  can be controlled by the parameter probability_coverage. Pay attention to
 *  the semantics, this is not the probability of the 2d-Gaussian on the 
 *  border of the ellipsis, in fact it is the integral of the 2d-gaussian 
 *  enclosed in the ellipsis.
 *
 *  \param ellipse_pose (out) will store the ellipsis position and angle
 *  \param radius_x (out) will store the first ellipsis radius
 *  \param radius_y (out) will store the second ellipsis radius
 *  \param hypothesis (in) contains the covariance matrix used
 *  \param probability_coverage (in) contains a value in the range [0,1]
 *    that represents the probability covered by the ellipsis.
