# Version definition
#
# you probably shouldn't change this, unless you're making changes
# to the Player server source and you want to distinguish your version
# from the 'original'.  the value of PLAYER_VERSION will be included
# in the server binary (it's printed out on console when Player runs, and
# sent back to the client when it connects), and is used below to construct
# the directory name for installation.

PLAYER_VERSION = 1.0a

#######################################
# Compiler selection
#
#   normally, you'll use the standard 'g++' and 'gcc' compilers. 
#
#   however, if you're running a glibc-2.2-based system (e.g., RedHat 7.x), 
#   and you want to run the resultant binaries on a glibc-2.1-based system
#   (e.g., RedHat 6.x), then use the 'i386-glibc21-linux-g++' and
#   'i386-glibc21-linux-gcc' compilers. note that you must have installed 
#   the compatibility compiler and library packages (they are included with 
#   the RedHat 7.x distro):
#     compat-libs-6.2-3
#     compat-glibc-6.2-2.1.3.2
#     compat-egcs-c++-6.2-1.1.2.14
#     compat-libstdc++-6.2-2.9.0.14
#     compat-egcs-6.2-1.1.2.14

# Install location selection
#
#
# player will be installed under the directory INSTALL_PREFIX.  by default,
# this directory name is constructed by appending PLAYER_VERSION to 
# INSTALL_BASE (e.g. '/usr/local/player0.8c'). change INSTALL_BASE 
# if you want to install somewhere else, but try to leave the version 
# identifier on there; makes things easier. 
#
PWD=$(shell pwd)

# RTV - added a dash between INSTALL_BASE and PLAYER_VERSION to make the name
# format more conventional; i.e. foosoft-1.0 rather than foosoft1.0
