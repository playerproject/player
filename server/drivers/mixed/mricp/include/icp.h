/* Iterated closest point (ICP) algorithm.
 * 
 * This is a very simple implementation of ICP, with one simple extension where the
 * association may be chosen as an interpolation between two nearest neighbours rather
 * than just point-to-point with the nearest neighbour.
 *
 * A lot of extensions to this basic algorithm are possible. For example,
 *	1. Record at each iteration the set of NN associations for each observation. 
 *	If these do not change, then ICP has converged completely.
 *	
 *	2. Various speed ups given in the following papers:
 *
 *	(a) P.J. Besl and N.D. McKay. A method for registration of 3-D shapes. IEEE 
 *	Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 14(2):239256, 1992.
 *
 *	(b) F. Lu and E. Milios. Robot pose estimation in unknown environments by matching
 *	2D range scans. Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems, 18:249275, 1997.
 *
 *	(c) S. Rusinkiewicz and M. Levoy. Efficient variants of the ICP algorithm. In Third
 *	International Conference on 3D Digital Imaging and Modeling, pages 145152, 2001.
 *
 *	3. Methods for estimating the error introduced by point-wise correspondence in 
 *	the paper (b) above and also:
 *
 *	S.T. P?ster, K.L. Kriechbaum, S.I. Roumeliotis, and J.W. Burdick. Weighted range
