 @brief iRobot Roomba

Newer versions of the iRobot Roomba vaccum robot can be controlled by an
external computer over a serial line.  This driver supports control of
these robots.  

Note that the serial port on top of the Roomba operates at 5V, not the
RS232 standard of 12V.  This means that you cannot just plug a plain
old serial cable between the Roomba and your PC's serial port.  You need
to put a level-shifter in between them.  Or you if have a computer that
exposes serial lines at "logic level," (e.g., the Gumstix), you can use
them directly.  Check out <a href="http://www.irobot.com/hacker">iRobot's
hacker site</a> for more information, including the pinout on the Roomba's
serial port.  The <a href="http://roomba.pbwiki.com">Roomba Wiki</a>
has a howto on building an appropriate serial cable.

@par Compile-time dependencies

- none

@par Provides

The roomba driver provides the following device interfaces:

- @ref interface_position2d
  - This interface returns odometry data, and accepts velocity commands.

@par Supported configuration requests

- None

@par Configuration file options

- port (string)
  - Default: "/dev/ttyS0"
  - Serial port used to communicate with the robot.
- safe (integer)
  - Default: 1
  - Nonzero to keep the robot in "safe" mode (the robot will stop if
    the wheeldrop or cliff sensors are triggered), zero for "full" mode

@par Example

@verbatim
driver
(
  name "roomba"
  provides ["position2d:0"]
  port "/dev/ttyS2"
  safe 1
)
@endverbatim

@todo
- Add power and bumper interfaces
- Recover from a cliff/wheeldrop sensor being triggered in safe mode;
the robot goes into passive mode when this happens, which right now
requires Player to be restarted
- Add some config requests, like position geometry
