/*
 * This device is designed for exchanging information between clients.
 * A client sends a message of a given "type" and "channel". This 
 * device stores adds the message to that channel's stack.
 * A second client can then request data of a given "type" and "channel"
 * if Pop is called the last piece of data added to the buffer is returned
 * and then deleted.
 * If Read is called the last piece of data added is returned, and left there
 * This is a filo, or a stack first in last out -
 * This way if were reading drive command for example we can be sure to
 * get a "STOP" and interupt a "FWD" before it's been read.
 * Player's "configuration"-style message passing is used.
