/*
 This is the new passthrough driver for Player 2.
 It does the following:
       - From the configuration file, reads requires ["SRC interface"], and provides ["DST interface"]
       - When a client connects to our DST interface, it subscribes to the SRC interface, and forwards all packets to the DST interface.
       - If the client sends a command to the DST, it gets forwarded to the SRC interfaces, and the ACK, NACK, or SYNCH answers get sent back to the DST interface
       - When the client disconnects from our DST interface, we unsubscribe from the SRC interface.
       - When forwarding packets, the header gets changed accordingly, specifically: devaddr (host, robot, interface, index)
*/

//Doxygen documentation taken partly from the old Player 1.x passthrough driver, and modified to fit the new one

/** @ingroup drivers */

/** @defgroup driver_passthrough passthrough
 * @brief General-purpose proxy driver

The @p passthrough driver relays packets between two player interfaces.
It connects as a @e client to an interface, and offers the same interface
to other clients. All communication packets are forwarded between the two.

This is specially useful to aggregate many player devices in a single Player
Server, and control them using only one connection. Probably the most
useful usage is to have a Player Server offering a stable set of interfaces,
that get forwarded to the appropriate Player Servers connected to the hardware.
If a device is moved around to a different computer, the clients don't have to
be reconfigured, since the change is done only in the server running the passthrough
driver.

The passthrough driver is also able to change its remote address at runtime. To do
this set the connect property to 0, and then change as needed the remote_host, remote_port
and remote_index properties. When you set connect to 1, it will connect to the new address.
Setting connect to -1 will trigger a disconnect followed by a connect allowing for seamless
transfer to a new remote device.

Subscribed clients will have all requests nack'd while the driver is disconnected.

@par Compile-time dependencies

- none

@par Provides

- The @p passthrough driver will support any of Player's interfaces,
  and can connect to any Player device.

@par Requires

- none

@par Configuration requests

- This driver will pass on any configuration requests.

@par Configuration file options

The @p passthrough driver can be used with local or remote interfaces using the
requires section in the configuration file.

For local interfaces, the format is:
@verbatim
driver
(
   name "passthrough"
   requires ["interface:index"]  // example: ["dio:0"]
   provides ["interface:anotherindex"] // example: ["dio:25"]
)
@endverbatim

To connect to an interface running on another server, the format is:
@verbatim
driver
(
   name "passthrough"
   requires [":hostname:port:interface:index"]   // example: [":someserver:6665:dio:0"]
   provides ["interface:someindex"] //example: [dio:0]
)
@endverbatim

Note that the in the case of connecting to remote interfaces, the provided interface can have
any index number. The driver changes the header accordingly.
