/*
 This is the new passthrough driver for Player 2.
 It does the following:
       - From the configuration file, reads requires ["SRC interface"], and provides ["DST interface"]
       - When a client connects to our DST interface, it subscribes to the SRC interface, and forwards all packets to the DST interface.
       - If the client sends a command to the DST, it gets forwarded to the SRC interfaces, and the ACK, NACK, or SYNCH answers get sent back to the DST interface
       - When the client disconnects from our DST interface, we unsubscribe from the SRC interface.
       - When forwarding packets, the header gets changed accordingly, specifically: devaddr (host, robot, interface, index)
*/

//Doxygen documentation taken partly from the old Player 1.x passthrough driver, and modified to fit the new one

/** @defgroup driver_passthrough passthrough
 * @brief General-purpose proxy driver

The @p passthrough driver relays packets between two player interfaces.
It connects as a @e client to an interface, and offers the same interface
to other clients. All communication packets are forwarded between the two.

This is specially useful to aggregate many player devices in a single Player
Server, and control them using only one connection. Probably the most
useful usage is to have a Player Server offering a stable set of interfaces,
that get forwarded to the appropriate Player Servers connected to the hardware.
If a device is moved around to a different computer, the clients don't have to
be reconfigured, since the change is done only in the server running the passthrough
driver.

@par Compile-time dependencies

- none

@par Provides

- The @p passthrough driver will support any of Player's interfaces,
  and can connect to any Player device.

@par Requires

- none

@par Configuration requests

- This driver will pass on any configuration requests.

@par Configuration file options

The @p passthrough driver can be used with local or remote interfaces using the
requires section in the configuration file.

For local interfaces, the format is:
@verbatim
driver
(
   name "passthrough"
   requires ["interface:index"]  // example: ["dio:0"]
   provides ["interface:anotherindex"] // example: ["dio:25"]
)
@endverbatim

To connect to an interface running on another server, the format is:
@verbatim
driver
(
   name "passthrough"
   requires [":hostname:port:interface:index"]   // example: [":someserver:6665:dio:0"]
   provides ["interface:someindex"] //example: [dio:0]
)
@endverbatim

Note that the in the case of connecting to remote interfaces, the provided interface can have
any index number. The driver changes the header accordingly.
