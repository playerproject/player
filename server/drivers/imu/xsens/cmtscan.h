	The cmtScanPorts function will scan registered Xsens USB converters and serial COM ports
	for connected Xsens devices. If the baudrate parameter is 0 (default), it will try to
	connect at all supported baud rates, starting with the most common 115k2, 460k8 and 
	58k6. If the baudrate parameter is non-zero, only the specified baudrate is tried.
	Any detected devices are returned in the ports list, which is sorted by port nr.
