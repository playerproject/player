// Each simulated device is allocated a block of shared memory.

//      info buffer -- device ids, plus timestamps and available byte-counts
//      data buffer
//      command buffer
//      config buffer
//      truth buffer

// these notes might be a little wrong - check stage's entity.cc behavior:
// player/stage info buffer
// available is set by stage and read by player.
// subscribed is set by player and read by stage.
// data_timestamp is set by stage and read by player.
// data_len is set by stage and read by player.
// command_len is set by player.
// config_len is set by player and reset (to zero) by stage.
