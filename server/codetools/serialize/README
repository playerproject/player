Usage:
  ./mkserialize.tcl < player.h

This Tcl script will parse a C header, such as <player.h>, and produce two
files:
  serialize.h
  serialize.c
Together, these files prototype and implement a pair of serialization and
deserialization functions for each struct declared in the header.

The parser is *very* primitive, and the ways in which you can confuse and/or
break it while still using valid C syntax are far too numerous to discuss
here.  Some hints to make it work right:

  - don't use multi-line comments
  - start every struct with a left-aligned '{' on its own line
  - don't mix differently-typed fields on the same line, such as:
       int x; short y;
  - however, you can do things like:
       int x,y;
