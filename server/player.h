This is the most important
request!  Before interacting with a device, the client must request
appropriate access.

  The access codes, which are used in both the request and response, are
 given above.   @b Read access means that the
 server will start sending data from the specified device. For instance, if
 read access is obtained for the sonar device Player will start sending sonar
 data to the client. @b Write access means that the client has permission
 to control the actuators of the device. There is no locking mechanism so
 different clients can have concurrent write access to the same actuators.
 @b All access is both of the above and finally @b close means that
 there is no longer any access to the device. Device request messages can
 be sent at any time, providing on the fly reconfiguration for clients
 that need different devices depending on the task at hand.  

 Of course, not all of the access codes are applicable to all devices;
 for instance it does not make sense to write to the sonars.   However,
 a request for such access will not generate an error; rather, it will be
 granted, but any commands actually sent to that device will be ignored.
 In response to such a device request, the server will send a reply indicating
 the @e actual access that was granted for the device.  The granted access
 may be different from the requested access; in particular, if there was
 some error in initializing the device the granted access will be @b error,
 and the client should not try to read from or write to the device. */

/** @brief Configuration request: Authentication.  

If server authentication has been enabled (by providing '-key &lt;key&gt;'
on the command-line; see @ref commandline); then each client must
authenticate itself before otherwise interacting with the server.
To authenticate, send a request with this format.

If the key matches the server's key then the client is authenticated,
the server will reply with a zero-length acknowledgement, and the client
can continue with other operations.  If the key does not match, or if
the client attempts any other server interactions before authenticating,
then the connection will be closed immediately.  It is only necessary
to authenticate each client once.

Note that this support for authentication is @b NOT a security mechanism.
The keys are always in plain text, both in memory and when transmitted
over the network; further, since the key is given on the command-line,
there is a very good chance that you can find it in plain text in the
process table (in Linux try 'ps -ax | grep player').  Thus you should
not use an important password as your key, nor should you rely on
Player authentication to prevent bad guys from driving your robots (use
a firewall instead).  Rather, authentication was introduced into Player
to prevent accidentally connecting one's client program to someone else's
robot.  This kind of accident occurs primarily when Stage is running in
a multi-user environment.  In this case it is very likely that there
is a Player server listening on port 6665, and clients will generally
connect to that port by default, unless a specific option is given.

This mechanism was never really used, and may be removed. */

The laser interface provides access to a single-origin scanning range

Devices supporting the laser interface can be configured to scan at
different angles and resolutions.  As such, the data returned by the

data simple, the laser data packet contains some extra fields before the
actual range data.  These fields tell the client the starting and ending
angles of the scan, the angular resolution of the scan, and the number of
range readings included.  Scans proceed counterclockwise about the laser
(0 degrees is forward).  The laser can return a maximum of 401 readings;
this limits the valid combinations of scan width and angular resolution.

META-NOTE: FIDUCIAL MESSAGING IS NOT WORKING IN STAGE CVS HEAD OR
STAGE-1.5

NOTE: These configs are currently supported only by the Stage fiducial
driver (stg_fidicial), but are intended to be a general interface for
addressable, peer-to-peer messaging.

The fiducial sensor can attempt to send a message to a target using the
PLAYER_FIDUCIAL_SEND_MSG request. If target_id is -1, the message is
broadcast to all targets. The device replies with an ACK if the message
was sent OK, but receipt by the target is not guaranteed. The intensity
field sets a transmit power in device-dependent units. If the consume flag
is set, the message is transmitted just once. If it is unset, the message
may transmitted repeatedly (at device-dependent intervals, if at all).

Send a PLAYER_FIDUCIAL_RECV_MSG request to obtain the last message
recieved from the indicated target. If the consume flag is set,
the message is deleted from the device's buffer, if unset, the same
message can be retreived multiple times until a new message arrives. The
power field indicates the intensity of the recieved messag, again in
device-dependent units.

Similarly, the PLAYER_FIDUCIAL_EXCHANGE_MSG request sends a message,
then returns the most recently received message. Depending on the device
and the situation, this could be a reflection of the sent message, a
reply from the target of the sent message, or a message received from
an unrelated sender.

clients.  A client sends a message of a given "type" and "channel". This
device stores adds the message to that channel's stack.  A second client
can then request data of a given "type" and "channel".  Push, Pop, Read,
and Clear operations are defined, but their semantics can vary, based
on the stack discipline of the underlying driver.  For example, the @ref
player_driver_lifomcom driver enforces a last-in-first-out stack.

This interface returns no data and accepts no commands.
