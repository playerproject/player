/**
The message class provides reference counting for a message that is 
to be delivered to several clients. This should save some data copying
and hopefully limit the speed overhead.

If these objects are going to be accessed from more than one thread
then locking should be added in the constructor/destructors
to make sure the reference counting is honoured correctly.

Drivers should have access to a create message function
which will take header, data and target client(can be set to all subscribed). 
This function will then create the message object and put it on the 
appropriate client queue/queues
