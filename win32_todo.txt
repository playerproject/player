- Fix usage of user-configured pthreads location

- Client libs other than libplayerc
- Utilities
- Python bindings
- Finding GTK
- Use DLL loading for plugins on Win32 instead of ltdl (I have plenty of experience here, it shouldn't take long to do)
- Installing and setting paths
- Write a wiki page about how to use Player on windows (environment variables that need to be set, etc)
- Make examples work
- Handle command line options
- Make the CMake modules not require pkg-config to build clients and plugins, to reduce dependencies for windows users
