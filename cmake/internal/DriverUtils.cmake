# Macros for managing driver compiling

# Global maps are used to store the build info because we need the variables to be available
# in the parent. This has the unfortunate side-effect that it's also available everywhere
# due to being in the cache. The alternative is to make all driver CMakeLists.txt files
# INCLUDEd at the server/ level, but this would open up the worse possbility of
# cross-directory bugs between those files, which is risky when we're having driver authors
# maintain their own.
