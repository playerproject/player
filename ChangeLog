	in lots of files:   - a 'player_device_id_t', which contains a
	device's code, index, and port,     is now passed in and out of
	configuration req/rep queues.  this allows     one device (e.g.,
	P2OS) to intelligently service requests actually     addressed to
	other devices.
	
	  - a 'player_device_id_t' is now stored in each device as well,
	under
	    the name 'device_id'.  it is public, and is set by
	    CDeviceTable::AddDevice() when the device is added to the
	instantiated
	    device table.  this allows devices to know who they are.  still
	not a
	    perfect solution because you might want to know in the
	constructor.

2002-06-03 23:49  rtv

	* src/: device.cc, stagedevice.cc: added initialization to
	CStageDevice::CStageDevice(), fixing a	horrible bug

2002-06-03 23:35  rtv

	* rtk2/rtk_canvas.c: improved support for distributed modes by
	creating stage client and server modes. stage can be as  run with
	or without the RTK2 GUI, which is now standard. In server mode (the
	default) stage reads a worldfile, creates external IO files and
	spawns a Player. In client mode (-c on the command line) stage
	connects to a server and downloads the world model. Clients may
	update devices, thus sharing the compulational load [NOT TESTED -
	PROBABLY BROKEN]. A client's GUI can be used as a remote world
	viewer. This replaces XS which has been removed. Lots to do here
	before this is releasable...

	  - changed all configurable devices to use new request/reply
	configuration
	    protocol (even when they don't use the incoming queue, like
	bps).  have
	    tested p2os devices and laser, but not laserbeacon or bps
	(Andrew?)
	
	  - added thread management support to CDevice. if, in your device,
	you
	    override the virtual class method 'void Main()', then you can
	call
	    'StartThread()', which will create a new thread and execute
	your method
	    in it.  this means that you have proper object context in the
	thread,
	    including the ability to access private members.  when you're
	done, just
	    call 'StopThread()', which will cancel() and join() the thread.
	
	    have converted all threaded devices to use this model, and have
	tested
	    all but bps (Andrew?)

	* rtk2/: Makefile, pyrtk.c, rtk.c, rtk.h, rtk_canvas.c, rtk_fig.c,

	Player's synchronous request/reply model for device configuration. 
	requests come in on queues, and replies go out on queues.
	
	this seems to work, and has been tested with all configurable
	devices, except the Mote.
	
	possible problem: Stage is now linking to some object code from
	Player, in order to get the PlayerQueue functionality, used in
	manipulating the request/reply queues.	maybe this could be
	avoided, with some thought...

	mutexes are now handled better between reader and writer threads;
	Player	    should always exit cleanly, even when in the middle of
	opening a device
	
	  - instead of usleep()ing after pthread_cancel(), we now
	pthread_join(), to
	     be sure that the thread is gone; removes much uncertainty
	
	  - PutData and GetData now always take 4 args, with the last two
	being
	    timestamps or pointers to timestamps, respectively.  if a
	device overrides
	    either of these methods, then it is responsible for doing its
	own
	    timestamping.
	
	  - P2OS devices should *almost* work now.  they share a common
	(static)
	    pthread_mutex, and Subsribe() and Unsubscribe() are overridden
	to access
	    it.  timestamping should work, but could be cleaner.  however,
	they are
	    still probably not accessing the same data and command buffers;
	need to
	    convert the non-allocating CDevice constructor into a
	SetupBuffers()
	    method that can be called by any device that needs to manage
	its own
	    storage (i.e., P2OS and StageDevice).

	(also CArenaLock is DEAD)
	
	locking facilities have been pushed into CDevice:   Lock();  
	Unlock(); if a device uses the default interface methods (GetData,
	etc.) provided in CDevice, then locking will be performed
	automatically, as before.  if a device chooses to override any of
	those default methods, then that device must Lock() and Unlock() of
	its own accord (usually just Lock() on entrance to the interface
	method, and Unlock() prior to exit).
	
	predictably, CStageDevice overrides Lock() and Unlock() to use the
	record locking mechanism, instead of pthread mutexes.
	
	one (sort of) unfortunate side-effect:	 - since i removed the
	concept of a Lock object (i was tired of all those     GetLock()
	calls), the Stage-style locking code is actually *replicated*	 
	in the StageTime class.  might be a way around this, i'll look
	later.
	
	this is NOT thoroughly tested, although Stage seems to work fine. 
	i can forsee two problem areas that i'll likely have to fix:
	
	  - P2OS devices probably don't share locking correctly any more
	
	  - data timestamping may or may not work correctly right now,
	especially
	    in devices which override the default interface methods.

	i've removed said methods from most devices, leaving only the one
	that do fancy things (e.g., bpsdevice does some coordinate

	    parameters.  also, the startup phase is more tolerant to

	device,

	CHANGE*
	
	the Player message protocol now includes a SYNCH message that is
	attached to the end of all of the data messages in each round of
	data.  the SYNCH message has its own new type (5) and is addressed
	from the Player device (1:0).  new datamodes are forthcoming.
	
	C,C++, and Tcl clients have been updated.  haven't bothered with
	LISP client yet.

	* Makefile, Makefile.common, client_libs/c/Makefile,
	client_libs/c++/Makefile: changed two things:	 - when C and C++
	clients are made, they do a 'false install' locally	 in the
	source tree by putting symlinks to their headers and libraries	   
	in 'lib' and 'include' directories at the top-level.  this makes
	the	 source tree look just like the install tree, so that
	client programs,      such as 'xs' can be built against the source
	tree.  thus, you can build	all of stage with 'make -e
	PLAYER_DIR=<path to Player source tree>'
	
	   - default install is now in user-space.  specifically, the
	default
	     INSTALL_PREFIX is now '$(HOME)/player-<version>'.

	packet format.	the vision device will now interact with either
	ACTS 1.0 or ACTS 1.2 (there's a 'version' command-line arg to pick
	your version), and will always output the new packet format, which
	is similar to ACTS 1.2, but byte-swapped rather than
	6-bits-per-byte-plus-one encoded.
	
	C++ and Tcl client libs have been updated; OLD C++ CLIENT NO LONGER
	WORKS!
	
	Lisp client doesn't have vision support yet...
