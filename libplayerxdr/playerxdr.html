@section overview Overview

When a player message is sent over a network, the message is formatted
according to XDR (eXternal Data Representation), a standard for the
description and encoding of data that is independent of the wordsize,
byte-order or other details of any particular architecture.  XDR specifies
a set of types (e.g., int, float, char) and encodings for them.  See
the XDR RFC (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1014.html) for details.

libplayerxdr is a C library that provides functions for translating
between player C message structs and their XDR representations.  Using
other terminology, libplayerxdr is a marshalling/demarshalling library.
By using libplayerxdr, application writers can avoid the inevitable bugs
and annoyances of writing their own (de)marshalling code.  Furthermore,
because libplayerxdr is automatically generated from &lt; @ref player.h &gt;,
the (de)marshalling code in libplayerxdr is less likely to get out of
sync with respect to the message structures than is manually-maintained
code.  The program that parses @ref <player.h> can also be used to parse
other header files, for example to generate XDR (de)marshalling code for
user-defined messages.  See below for usage.

@section libplayerxdr libplayerxdr

Each player message is defined as a C @c struct in &lt; @ref player.h &gt;.
For each @c struct @c player_foo, libplayerxdr defines a single
function of the following name and form:
@code
   int player_foo_pack(void* buf, size_t buflen, player_foo_t* msg, int op);
@endcode

@param buf The XDR-encoded buffer that is being encoded / decoded.
@param buflen Size of buf, in bytes.
@param msg Pointer to the C struct that is being encoded / decoded.
@param op Either PLAYERXDR_ENCODE or PLAYERXDR_DECODE

@returns On success, the length of the XDR-encoded buffer, and -1
         otherwise (e.g., the buffer was not large enough).

This function will either pack (encode to XDR) or unpack (decode from
XDR), depending on the last argument.  

@subsection encoding Encoding a message

When encoding a message, the caller is responsible for allocating enough
space to @p buf to hold the XDR-encoded format of the message.  The
XDR-encoded message will be, at most, 4 times larger than the original
struct, so it is sufficient to allocate a buffer that is 4 times the @c
sizeof of the struct.

For example, if you have a message @p msg of type @c struct @c player_foo
that you want to encode, you might do something like this:
@code
char* xdrbuf;
int buflen;

// Allocate space for the encoded message.  XDR will inflate a structure
// by at most 4 times.
buflen = sizeof(struct player_foo) * 4;
xdrbuf = (char*)calloc(1, buflen);
assert(xdrbuf);

// Encode the message
if((buflen = player_foo_pack(xdrbuf, buflen, &msg, PLAYERXDR_ENCODE)) < 0)
{
  // Packing failed, probably because you didn't allocate
  // enough space to xdrbuf.
}
else
{
  // Packing succeeded; you might now, for example, write() xdrbuf onto a
  // socket.  The actual length of the encoded buffer is buflen.
}
@endcode

@subsection decoding Decoding a message

If you have received from the network a message @p xdrbuf, of length @p buflen,
and you know it to be of type @c player_foo, you can decode it like so:
@code
struct player_foo msg;

// Decode the message
if((buflen = player_foo_pack(xdrbuf, buflen, &msg, PLAYERXDR_DECODE)) < 0)
{
  // Unpacking failed, probably because the message wasn't long enough
}
else
{
  // Unpacking succeeded; you can now read the data from msg.
}
@endcode


@subsection types Types

The following primitive types are defined by XDR, and can be used in player
messages.  For each XDR type, some corresponding C types are given, along
with the size of the type when XDR-encoded.
 - boolean; @c unsigned @c int; 4 bytes each
 - character; @c char; 4 bytes each
 - unsigned character; @c unsigned @c char; 4 bytes each
 - 16-bit integer; @c short, @c int16_t; 4 bytes each
 - 16-bit unsigned integer; @c unsigned @c short, @c uint16_t; 4 bytes each
 - 32-bit integer; @c int, @c int32_t; 4 bytes each
 - 32-bit unsigned integer; @c unsigned @c int, @c uint32_t; 4 bytes each
 - 64-bit hyper integer; @c long, @c int64_t; 8 bytes each
 - 64-bit unsigned hyper integer; @c unsigned @c long, @c uint64_t; 8 bytes each
 - 32-bit floating point number; @c float; 4 bytes each
 - 64-bit floating point number; @c double; 8 bytes each

Nested structures are supported.  Each field, whether it is a structure or
a primitive type, is encoded in the order that it is declared in the
structure definition.

Pointers are NOT supported.  To be XDR-encoded, a message structure must
contain all its data.  An exception (of sorts) is the encoding of arrays,
described next.

@subsubsection arrays Arrays

One-dimensional arrays are supported.  An array may contain either
a primitive type, or a structure.  Multi-dimensional arrays are not
supported.

An array may either be fixed-length or variable-length.  To declare a
variable-length array named @c bar, the message structure must also contain
an unsigned integer (@c uint32_t) field named @c bar_count.  This field
will contain the actual element count of the array when encoding and
decoding.  If there is no @c bar_count field, then the array @c bar will be
encoded fixed-length.  

Before encoding a structure with a variable-length array, you @b must
fill in the corresponding _count field; that's the only way for the
packing function to know how much of the array you're actually using.

In either case, the array must be declared in the message structure to
occupy its maximum length.   For example, the @c player_bumper_data
structure contains a variable-length array of bumper values that can hold
at most 32 such values:
@code
#define PLAYER_BUMPER_MAX_SAMPLES ((uint8_t)32)
typedef struct player_bumper_data
{
  uint32_t bumpers_count;
  uint8_t bumpers[PLAYER_BUMPER_MAX_SAMPLES];
} player_bumper_data_t;
@endcode
Three examples of fixed-length arrays can be seen in the @c
player_fiducial_geom structure:
@code
typedef struct player_fiducial_geom
{
  float pose[3];
  float size[2];  
  float fiducial_size[2];
} player_fiducial_geom_t;
@endcode
In this structure, each array will always be its maximum length, so there is
nothing to be gained by allowing for them to vary.

@subsection bytearrays Character arrays (strings)

According to the XDR specification, arrays of characters (e.g., char
foo[8]) should be encoded as a sequence of XDR-encoded characters, each
occupying 4 bytes.  We use a small optimization here: arrays of the
following types:
- int8_t
- uint8_t
- char
- unsigned char

are encoded as opaque XDR "byte arrays", using xdr_bytes().  The encoding
uses just one byte per character.

@section parser Parsing user-defined messages

The functions in libplayerxdr are automatically generated by a Python script
that parses &lt; @ref player.h &gt;.  This script can also be used to parse a
header containing user-defined messages.   The script, @c
libplayerxdr/parse.py in the player distribution, can be used like so:
@code
  parse.py foo.h foopack.c foopack.h
@endcode
This command will parse the header foo.h and define in foopack.c functions
that (de)marshall all the structures found in foo.h.  Prototypes for these
functions will be written into foopack.h.  You could then compile foopack.c
into libfoopack.a; any application needing to encode or decode the messages
defined in foo.h would #include <foopack.h> and link to libfoopack.a.

This usage of parse.py is currently experimental.
