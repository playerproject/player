- Fix installation of python bindings to install to a less-generic location (use distutils to install if possible)
- Java bindings for core, xdr, tcp, etc
- Make sure all the various package searches are actually performed and options are available to change install paths of them
- Figure out why it always rebuilds driverregistry.c. Make it stop.
. cross-compiling... does it work? - better support in CMake v2.6, apparently
- dist tarballs, packages, etc - add in the extra_dist files to the source one, make the debian one
- Drivers being disabled by a check used to correctly force their option to off. Figure out why this broke. Fix it.
- Figure out why C++ tests and C++ examples don't link properly when building as static libs, even though the server and utils do.
- Add CMakeLists equivalent of the wavefront driver's Makefile.test (and get rid of Makefile.test)
- Interfaces don't get reprocessed when the .def files change. Probably because of the glob. Fix this.
