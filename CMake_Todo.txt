- Python bindings for libplayerc (or c++?)
- Java bindings for core, xdr, tcp, etc
- Make sure all the various package searches are actually performed and options are available to change install paths of them
- Get CMake book, read it, go through all cmake files and clean up the mess I've made
- Check all necessary flags are being accumulated from various libraries and passed to various executable build steps (e.g. defines for boost stuff, is it needed for playerprint?)
- Figure out why it always rebuilds driverregistry.c. Make it stop.
- cross-compiling... does it work?
- all those driver make files
- install config files (easy)
- examples dir (probably easy)
- docs (easy)
- dist tarballs, packages, etc
