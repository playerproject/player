/** @defgroup libplayertcp libplayertcp
 * @brief Player TCP library

This library moves messages between Player message queues and TCP sockets.

@section datamode_protocol Data modes

Clients can use two modes for receiving data. These are PUSH and PULL modes.
There are some important differences between them. These are summarised here.
These modes only affect the clients' message queues, that is they do not
affect how messages are received from clients.

In PUSH mode all messages are sent as soon as possible. This is usually when
there is room in the operating system's buffer for the message. Clients should
read these messages as usual. For example, the libplayerc client library will
read exactly one message for each call to the client read function.

In PULL mode:
<ul>
<li>Messages are only sent to the client when they are marked as ready in the
client's message queue.
<li>PLAYER_MSGTYPE_DATA messages are not marked as ready until the client
requests data.
<li>All other messages (PLAYER_MSGTYPE_RESP_ACK and PLAYER_MSGTYPE_RESP_NACK
messages) are marked as ready upon entering the queue.
<li>When a PLAYER_PLAYER_REQ_DATA message is received, all messages in the
client's queue are marked as ready. A PLAYER_MSGTYPE_SYNCH message is pushed
onto the end of the queue.
</ul>

A client in PULL mode should request data before performing a read by sending a
PLAYER_PLAYER_REQ_DATA request message. The client should then continue to
receive and handle all messages until it receives the PLAYER_MSGTYPE_SYNCH
message. Note that the PLAYER_MSGTYPE_RESP_ACK for the PLAYER_PLAYER_REQ_DATA
will come at the <i>end</i> of all other waiting data (but <i>before</i> the
PLAYER_MSGTYPE_SYNCH message), due to the way the message queue system
functions. This means that client libraries should read and store all other
messages when waiting for a PLAYER_MSGTYPE_RESP_ACK, then process them at
the beginning of their read function after sending the PLAYER_PLAYER_REQ_DATA
message.
