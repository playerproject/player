 * this function creates a socket of the indicated type and binds it to 
 * the indicated port.
 *
 * NOTE: we pick the IP address (and thus network interface) for binding 
 *       by calling gethostname() and then stripping it down to the first
 *       component (i.e. no domain name).  if this process won't
 *       result in the IP address that you want, tough luck.
 *
 * ARGS:
 *  serverp: this is a value-result param that will contain the socket's info
 *  blocking: whether or not it should be blocking
 *  portnum: port to bind() to
 *  socktype: should be SOCK_DGRAM (for UDP) or SOCK_STREAM (for TCP)
 *  backlog: number of waiting connections to be allowed (TCP only)
 *
 * RETURN: 
 *  On success, the fd of the new socket is returned.  Otherwise, -1 
 *  is returned and an explanatory note is dumped to stderr.
