@page install Installation

In principle Player should build on most modern Unix-like
distributions using the standard GNU autoconf dance:

@verbatim
$ ./configure
$ make install
@endverbatim

In practice, this will probably install a fairly minimal set of
drivers, so read on for more detailed installation instructions.


@section install_prepare Preparing your system (recommended)

The default install path for many source packages (Player included)
is:

@verbatim
/usr/local
/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/include
/usr/local/lib
@endverbatim

In some Linux distributions, however, these paths are not searched by
default, leading to problems when compiling and linking.  We therefore
recommend that you configure your system with the following additional
paths (added to your .bashrc script, for example):

@verbatim
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
export CPATH=/usr/local/include:$CPATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
@endverbatim

The first line sets the executable path; the second sets the path for
C and C++ header files; the third line sets the library search path.
You will also need to set two more paths:

@verbatim
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
@endverbatim 

The first line sets the pkg-config path (a neat utility for mananging
source dependencies); the second line is for Python extensions (the
version number should match the version of Python you have installed;
type "python -V" if in doubt).


@section install_gazebo Installing Gazebo (optional)

If you plan to work with the <a
href="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/gazebo/gazebo.html">Gazebo</a>
simulation package, you need to install Gazebo @b before installing
Player.  Follow the installation instructions in the Gazebo <a
href="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/doc.html">manual</a>.


@section install_rtk Installing RTK (recommended)

Some Player utilities use the RTK library (available from the Player
website) for managing GUI functionality.  This package should be
installed @b before installing Player.  The RTK source tarball is
installed as follows:

@verbatim
$ tar xvzf librtk-src-<version>.tar.gz
$ cd librtk-src-<version>
$ ./configure
@endverbatim

Check the output of the configure script to make sure the
package will be installed in a sensible place.  Now build and
install:

@verbatim
$ make
$ su
$ make install
$ exit
@endverbatim


@section install_root Standard installation

The Player source tarball is installed as follows:

@verbatim
$ tar xvzf player-<version>.tar.gz
$ cd player-<version>
$ ./configure
@endverbatim

Note the final output of the configure script: it will tell you
what will be built, and where it will be installed.
Once you are satisfied, build and install the package:

@verbatim
$ make
$ su
$ make install
$ exit
@endverbatim

Player is now ready to run.


@section install_local Local installation (does not require root access)

Some users prefer to install Player in their home directory (e.g.,
/home/[username]/local) rather than in a system directory.  This is
useful if you are working on shared machines and/or lack root access.
Naturally, local installs can make it a bit tricky for Player (and
other packages) to find the right headers, libs and so on.  Here,
then, is the recommended way to do it:
 
- Pick a spot for "local" installs; for me it is
 "/home/[username]/local".  The install scripts will create relevant
 subdirs under this, such as:
@verbatim
/home/[username]/local/bin
/home/[username]/local/include
/home/[username]/local/lib
@endverbatim
 
- Set up the necessary compiler paths in your .bashrc (or whatever)
  script; e.g.:
@verbatim
export PATH=~/local/bin:$PATH
export CPATH=~/local/include:$CPATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=~/local/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
@endverbatim
The first line sets the executable path; the second sets the path for C
and C++ header files; the third line sets the library search path.
 
- Set up some additional paths in your .bashrc (or whatever):
@verbatim
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=~/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=~/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
@endverbatim 
The first line sets the pkg-config path (for applications using
pkg-config, which will be everything in the Player/Stage/Gazebo
project pretty soon); the second line is for Python extensions (the
version number should match the version of Python you have installed;
type "python -V" if in doubt).

- Build RTK using the "--prefix" argument:
@verbatim
$ ./configure --prefix=/home/[username]/local
$ make install
@endverbatim
Note the final output of the configure script: it should tell
you that RTK will be installed in your home directory.

- Build Player using the "--prefix" argument:
@verbatim
$ ./configure --prefix=/home/[username]/local
$ make install
@endverbatim
Note the final output of the configure script: it should find your
local installation of RTK and tell you that Player will be installed
in your home directory.
 
Everything should now work seamlessly, and your locally installed
packages will be used in preference to any system-wide defaults.

@section install_stage Installing Stage 1.3.x (optional)

If you plan to work with the <a
href="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/stage/stage.html">Stage</a>
simulation package, you need to install Stage @b after installing
Player.  Follow the installation instructions in the Stage <a
href="http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/doc/Stage-manual-1.3.3-html/node13.html">manual</a>.

In a nutshell, after installing Player, './configure; make; make install'
should get Stage installed (provide the same @p --prefix argument to
Stage's configure as you did for Player).  Note that in order to build
the Stage GUI (it can run without a GUI, but it's not much fun), you @e
must first install RTK.
