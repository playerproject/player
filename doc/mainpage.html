/** @mainpage Player Server Manual

What is Player? Player is a robot device server.  It gives you simple
and complete control over the physical sensors and actuators on your
mobile robot.  When Player is running on your robot, your client
control program connects to it via a standard TCP socket, and
communication is accomplished by the sending and receiving of some of
a small set of simple messages.

Player is designed to be language and platform independent.  Your
client program can run on any machine that has network connectivity to
your robot, and it can be written in any language that can open and
control a TCP socket.  Client-side libraries are currently available
for C, C++, Tcl, LISP, Java, and Python.

Player also makes no assumptions about how you might want to structure
your robot control programs; i.e., Player is architecturally neutral.


@section mainpage_usage Quick-start Guide

@par Starting the Player server

The Player server is run as follows:
@verbatim
$ player [options] <configfile>
@endverbatim

The configuration file is a text file describing the set of devices to
be instantiated; for example, if you have an ActivMedia Pioneer and a
SICKLMS200 scanning laser range finder:

@verbatim
driver
(
  name "p2os_position"
  provides ["position:0"]
)

driver
(
  name "sicklms200"
  provides ["laser:0"]
  port "/dev/ttyS1"
)
@endverbatim

This file instructs the server to create two devices:
  - A Pioneer P2OS driver, supporting the @ref player_interface_position interface.
  - A Sick LMS200 driver, supporting the @ref player_interface_laser interface.
Client programs can subsequently connect to these devices, read data,
send commands and so forth (see below).

Note the important distinction between drivers, interfaces and devices:
  - A @b driver supports a @e specific piece of hardware, such as a SICK LMS200
    scanning laser range-finder.
  - An @b interface is a @e generic mechanism for getting data and/or
    sending commands to a piece of hardware.
  - A @b device describes a specific driver/interface pairing; e.g., a SICK LMS200
    driver which supports the @ref player_interface_laser interface.
.
Devices are also given an @b index to facilitate unique addressing
(e.g., "laser:0" or "laser:1"); this allows the server to instantiate
more than one device with the same interface.


@par Writing a Player client

Users can write programs to communicate with the Player server.  In
principle, this can be done using Player's low-level
network-socket-base protocol.  In practice, most users will avail
themselves of one of the existing @e client @e libraries; the
libraries manage the network interactions, data marshalling and so on,
and present a much more convenient API.  

For example, the following code fragment demonstrates a simple client
using the @ref player_clientlib_libplayerc library.

@include simpleclient.c

This example can be built using the commands:
@verbatim
$ gcc -c simple.c -o simple.o
$ gcc -lm -lplayerc simple.o -o simple
@endverbatim

With the server already started, you can run the example with:
@verbatim
$ ./simple
@endverbatim

Assuming everything is plugged in and turned on, your robot should
scoot across the room.

Client libraries also exist for C, C++, Tcl, LISP, Java, and Python.
