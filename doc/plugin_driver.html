@page plugin_driver HOWTO: Creating a Plugin Driver

The are two distinct type of drivers in Player:

- <i>Static</i> drivers have their code in the main Player
distribution, and are statically linked into the server.  Generally
speaking, such drivers will be added by the lead developers.

- <i>Plugin</i> drivers are shared objects that are loaded at runtime
(like loadable modules in the Linux kernel). They are the recommended
method for all new, experimental or third party drivers.

Plugin drivers have serveral advantanges over their static
counterparts:

- They are easier to build (no mucking about with autotools, or
digging about in the server internals).

- They permit rapid development and a much faster code/compile/test
cycle (the server does not need to be recompiled/relinked when the
driver changes).

- Code can be maintained in a separate source repository.  This is
particularly useful for users with funky one-off drivers that belong
with the rest of their code, data, papers, etc (and not in the Player
source tree).

This document describes the process for creating new plugin drivers.
It assumes you are familiar with C++, class inheritance, and thread
programming.


@section plugin_drivers_example A plugin driver example

Sample code for a very basic plugin driver is provided in the
<tt>examples</tt> directory; for a default install, this will be:

@verbatim
/usr/local/src/player/examples/plugins/exampledriver/
@endverbatim

Copy the files from this directory and rename
<tt>Makefile.example</tt> to <tt>Makefile</tt>.  Try building the
example:

@verbatim
$ make 
@endverbatim

This produces a plugin driver named <tt>exampledriver.so</tt>.
You can test the model using the included configuration file:

@verbatim
$ player ./example.cfg
@endverbatim

The driver block in the config file has an additional field @c plugin
specifying the path to the plugin, i.e.,:

@verbatim
driver
(
  name "exampledriver"
  plugin "exampledriver.so"
  provides ["position:0"] 
  ...
)
@endverbatim


@section plugin_drivers_simple Writing a simple driver

The first step in creating a new driver is to decide which interface
it will support.  The existing interfaces are described in the <a
href="modules.html">reference</a> section, and their various message
structures and constants are defined in player.h.  Although you can
create a new interface, you should try to fit your driver to an
existing interface, of which there are many.  By deciding to support
an existing interface, you'll have less work to do in the server, and
will likely have instant client support for your driver in several
languages.

To create a new driver, you should create a new class for the driver,
which should inherit from the Driver class.  This base class defines a
standard API, part of which the new driver must implement (other parts
it may choose to override).  We now describe the salient aspects of
the Driver class.


@subsection plugin_drivers_simple_c The constructor

Simple drivers will use the following Driver constructor:

@verbatim
Driver::Driver(ConfigFile *cf, int section, int interface, uint8_t access,
               size_t datasize, size_t commandsize, 
               size_t reqqueuelen, size_t repqueuelen);
@endverbatim

This constructor will establish the buffers and queues that allow the
Player server to interface with the driver.  The preamble for the
example driver, for example, looks like this:

@verbatim 
ExampleDriver::ExampleDriver(ConfigFile* cf, int section)
    : Driver(cf, section, PLAYER_POSITION_CODE, PLAYER_ALL_MODE,
             sizeof(player_position_data_t), sizeof(player_position_cmd_t), 10, 10)
{
 ...
}
@endverbatim

The preamble indicates that this driver:

- Supports the position interface (indicated by @c
  PLAYER_POSITION_CODE);
- Allows read/write access from clients (@c PLAYER_ALL_MODE);
- Has a data buffer large enough to accomodate a
  standard position interface data packet (@c sizeof(player_position_data_t));
- Has a command buffer large enough to accomodate a
  standard position interface command packet (@c sizeof(player_position_cmd_t));
- Can queue up to 10 incoming configuration requests and 10 outgoing
  configuration replies.

The @c cf and @c section parameters are passed in by the server; these
values to access driver-specific options stored in the Player
configuration file.  Thus, for example, the driver constructor can
read the value of some setting "foo":

@verbatim
this->foop = cf->ReadInt(section, "foo", 0);
@endverbatim

This might be the serial port from which to read data, for example.
See the ConfigFile documentation for the various kinds of options that
can be read from the configuration file.


@subsection plugin_drivers_simple_set Setup()

When the first client subscribes to a driver, the driver's Setup()
method is called; every driver @b must implement this method.  The
Setup() method generally does two things:

- Do some device-specific initialization (e.g., open a serial port).
- Start the driver thread using Driver::StartThread().

Player is a multi-threaded application, with most drivers running in
their own thread; this makes it particularly easy to write drivers
that read/write data from serial ports, network sockets, disk files
and so on.

After initialization, Setup() should return either zero to indicate
that the device was successfully setup, or non-zero to indicate that
setup failed (the latter will cause Player to terminate).


@subsection plugin_drivers_simple_shut Shutdown()

When the last client unsubscribes from a device, the driver's
Shutdown() method is called; every driver @b must implement this
method.  The Shutdown() method generally does two things:

- Stop the driver thread using Driver::StopThread().
- Do some device-specific finalization (e.g., close a serial port).

Note that the ordering is important here: we must shut down the driver
thread @b before we release the resources it is using; to this end,
Driver::StopThread() will tell the driver thread to quit, and wait
until it exits before returning.

Shutdown() should return either zero to indicate that device was
successfully shutdown, or non-zero to indicate that shutdown failed.


@subsection plugin_drivers_simple_main Main()

The Driver::Startup() method will result in the creation of a new
thread of control, which will immediately call Driver::Main().  Every
driver must this overload this method.  The overloaded Main() method
is generally responsible for translating between some device-specific
API and the standard Player interfaces.  The basic steps are as
follows:

- For incoming data:
  - Read data from some external device (over a serial port, for example).
  - Massage the data into one of the Player interface data structures.
  - Write the data to the Player server using Driver::PutData().

- For outgoing data (commands):
  - Read commands from the Player server using Driver::GetCommand().
  - Massage the command into a device specific format.
  - Write the command to the external device.

The Driver::PutData() and Driver::GetCommand() methods manage all of
the buffering and locking required to synchronize the driver and
server threads.

The overloaded Main() method is also responsible for handling
any configuration request sent to the driver; the basic steps are as
follows:

- Check for a new request using Driver::GetConfig().
- Do whatever needs to be done for this request.
- Send a response using Driver::PutReply().

Note that your driver must respond, one way or another, to each and
every request.  Failing to respond to requests will cause client
programs to "hang" when talking to the driver.

The overloaded Main() must also be capable of graceful termination
(i.e., the function should exit cleanly when the user kills the
server).  This can be achieved by calling @c pthread_testcancel() from
within the main loop.  This function checks to see if the driver
thread should terminate, and if so, immediately exits Main().  If
additional cleanup is required, drivers can also overload
Driver::MainQuit(), which is guaranteed to be called on thread
termination.


@subsection plugin_drivers_simple_instant Instantiation

In order to instantiate a driver, the Player server needs to know two
things:

- The driver's name (as it will appear in the configuration file).  
- The driver's @b factory function (used to create a new instance of
  the driver).  The factory function will generally look something
  like this:

@verbatim
Driver* ExampleDriver_Init(ConfigFile* cf, int section)
{
  return ((Driver*) (new ExampleDriver(cf, section)));
}
@endverbatim

Note that this function may be called multiple times: once for each
occurance of the driver name in the configuration file.

Each driver must register itself with the server using the
DriverTable::AddDriver(), providing the driver name and factory
function.  Drivers must therefore define a registration function
as follows:

@verbatim
void ExampleDriver_Register(DriverTable* table)
{
  table->AddDriver("exampledriver", ExampleDriver_Init);
}
@endverbatim

This function must be called exactly once, on program startup.  For
plugin drivers, this can be achieved by defining an initialization
function for the shared object:

@verbatim
extern "C" 
{
  int player_driver_init(DriverTable* table)
  {
    ExampleDriver_Register(table);
    return 0;
  }
}
@endverbatim

This function will be called when the shared object is loaded, before
any drivers are instantiated.  The @c extern @c "C" block is used to
prevent C++ name mangling of the intialization function.


@section plugin_drivers_building Building the shared library

The example driver includes a Makefile for building shared objects.
To manually build a shared object, try:

@verbatim
$ g++ -Wall -g3 -c exampledriver.cc
$ g++ -shared -nostartfiles -o exampledriver.so exampledriver.o
@endverbatim

While the above method will probably work, it is recommended that you
use pkg-config to get the compile flags; i.e.,

@verbatim
$ g++ -Wall -g3 `pkg-config --cflags player` -c exampledriver.cc
$ g++ -shared -nostartfiles -o exampledriver.so exampledriver.o
@endverbatim
