FAQ page</a>.

Next, you should search <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=8201">the
playerstage-users mailing list archive</a> to
see if your questions have already been answered.

@page install Installation

<h2>Standard install procedure</h2>

<p>To install Player in the default location (/usr/local), follow these steps:

<ol>

<li>Download the latest Player source tarball (player-\<version\>.tgz)
from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=42445">SourceForge</a>.

<li>Uncompress and expand the tarball: <br>
    <tt>$ tar xzvf player-\<version\>.tgz</tt>

<li>`cd' into Player's source directory:<br>
     <tt>$ cd player-\<version\></tt>
 
<li>To configure Player with default settings:<br>
<tt>$ ./configure</tt><br>

<li>Compile Player:<br>
<tt>$ make</tt>

<li>Install Player. By default, Player will be installed in
<tt>/usr/local</tt> so you need to become root for this step. Remember
to return to your normal user ID afterwards. <br> 
<tt>$ make install</tt>

</ol>

<h2>Customized installations</h2>

<p>Player follows the standard GNU autotools conventions for build and
install options. To see a list of all the available configuration
options, do this:

<p><tt>./configure --help</tt>

<p>The most important option is <tt>--prefix</tt>, used
to change the installation directory from the default (which varies
from system to system, but is usually <tt>/usr/local</tt>).
Prefixes must be absolute paths, i.e. a complete path starting with a '/'.

<p>For example, you might want to install Player in your home directory
because you don't have root access:

<p><tt>$./configure --prefix=/home/gerkey/ps</tt>


@todo Talk about more configure options here, like disable-alldrivers.

/** 
@defgroup libplayercore libplayercore

\section synopsis Synopsis
This C++ library defines the device driver API, the message queues used to
move messages between devices, facilities for parsing configuration files
and for loading and instantiating drivers.

The primary components of libplayercore are:
  - @ref message_basics : The basics of Player-based messaging, including
    size limits, unit specifications, and address structures.
  - @ref interfaces : The syntax and semantics of all the messages for each
    Player interface.
  - @ref ConfigFile : Configuration file parsing
  - @ref Message : 
  - @ref MessageQueue : 
  - @ref Driver :
  - @ref Device :

\section linking Example compilation and linkage
The most common usage of libplayercore is in building a plugin driver.  If
the code for your driver is in mydriver.cc, you can build it like this (on
Linux):
\code
  $ g++ `pkg-config --cflags playercore` -o -shared mydriver.so mydriver.cc `pkg-config --libs playercore`
\endcode


*/

/** 
@defgroup libplayererror libplayererror

This C library provides error-reporting and debug output facilities.
Instead of calling directly into the stdio library (printf, puts, etc.),
use the macros defined in error.h, so that message verbosity can be
centrally controlled and so that all messsages get logged to .player.
