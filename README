Configuration 
------------------
- read Makefile.common! there are several compile-time configurations that 
  you can change, such as your platform and compiler, the devices to include, 
  and the directory to which the installation go.  they are all explained (and
  can be changed) in Makefile.common.

Build 
------------------
- if your machine (i.e. robot) has its clock set wrong (like most of ours)
  you'll want touch all the files to fix clock skew and ensure a complete 
  build:

     $ find . -exec touch {} \;

- then build (in the top-level directory):

     $ make


Install 
--------------------
- to install everything (server binary, client libraries and headers,
    and examples) in the selected install directory (default is
    /usr/local/player<version>):

      # make install

  the executable server itself will install (by default) as 
  /usr/local/player<version>/bin/player.

- if you want to install somewhere else, change INSTALL_BASE in 
  Makefile.common

Uninstall
--------------------
- to uninstall everything (server binary, client libraries and headers,
    and examples) from wherever it was installed (you need to be root, 
    of course):

      # make uninstall

Clean
--------------------
- to clean up (remove all binaries, etc.).  doesn't uninstall from
    the system.

      # make clean
    

Further Info
------------
- now you've got Player installed.  but, how to use it? user manual
  is in ./doc.  for further info and updates, check:
