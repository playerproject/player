Configuration 
------------------
- read Makefile.common! there are several compile-time configurations that 
  you can change, such as your platform and compiler, the devices to include, 
  and the directory to which the installation go.  they are all explained (and
  can be changed) in Makefile.common.

Build 
------------------
- in the top-level directory:

     $ make


Install 
--------------------
- to install everything (server binary, client libraries and headers,
    and examples) in the selected install directory (default is 
    $(HOME)/player-<version>):

      $ make install

  the executable server itself will install (by default) as 
  $(HOME)/player-<version>/bin/player.

- if you want to install somewhere else (like in /usr/local)
    change INSTALL_BASE in Makefile.common

Uninstall
--------------------
- to uninstall everything (server binary, client libraries and headers,
    and examples) from wherever it was installed:

      $ make uninstall

--------------------
- to clean up (remove all binaries, etc.).  doesn't uninstall from
    the system.

      $ make clean
