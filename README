Player - one hell of a robot server
----------------------------------
This is the Player device interface, developed at the SRI AI Center, with
help from many other places, and released under the GNU General Public
License (GPL).  The Player homepage is:

  http://playerstage.sourceforge.net


Installation
------------
Read INSTALL for generic instructions.  For most people, the following
sequence will suffice:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

To see the options accepted by configure, do:

  $ ./configure --help

Bootstrapping from SVN
----------------------
If you are building from SVN you will not have a configure script. This is
created by running autoreconf

  $ autoreconf -i
