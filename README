Configuration
------------------
- Platform selection: Player currently builds on Linux/x86 and Solaris/Sparc.
  In the top-level Makefile, choose your platform by commenting/uncommenting
  the appropriate lines

- Device support: you can control whether or not various device support is 
  compiled into your Player server.  look in src/Makefile for variables with 
  names like 'INCLUDE_LASER'.  comment out the ones you don't want and 
  uncomment the ones you do.  you can also leave out support for Stage in 
  this way.  having said that, you should know that the Player binary is quite
  small (92KB, stripped), and you don't save much space by leaving out support
  for a device.

- Install location: by default, Player will install into: 
    /usr/local/player<version>
  where <version> is something like '1.1'.  This allows you to have multiple
  versions of Player installed simultaneously.  You can control the exact
  install directory by changing the value of 'INSTALL_PREFIX' in the
  top-level Makefile.

Build 
------------------
- if your machine (i.e. robot) has its clock set wrong (like most of ours)
  you'll want touch all the files to fix clock skew and ensure a complete 
  build:

     $ find . -exec touch {} \;

- then build (in the top-level directory):

     $ make


Install 
--------------------
- to install everything (server binary, client libraries and headers,
    and examples) in /usr/local/player (you need to be root, of course):

      # make install

  the executable server itself will install as /usr/local/player/bin/player.

- if you want to install somewhere else, change INSTALL_PREFIX in Makefile

Uninstall
--------------------
- to uninstall everything (server binary, client libraries and headers,
    and examples) from wherever it was installed (you need to be root, 
    of course):

      # make uninstall

Clean
--------------------
- to clean up (remove all binaries, etc.).  doesn't uninstall from
    the system.

      # make clean
    

Further Info
------------
- now you've got Player installed.  but, how to use it? user manual
  is in ./doc.  for further info and updates, check:
