Player - one hell of a robot server
----------------------------------
This is the Player device server, developed at the Stanford AI Lab, the
USC Robotics Research Lab, the Simon Fraser Autonomy Lab (with help from
many other places), and released under the GNU General Public License
(GPL).  The Player homepage is:

  http://playerstage.sourceforge.net


Installation
------------
Read INSTALL for generic instructions.  For most people, the following
sequence will suffice:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

To see the options accepted by configure, do:

  $ ./configure --help

If you need to pass a lot of options to configure, you might find it easier
to write a little script to invoke configure for you.  There are a couple of
examples included in this directory (e.g., config.simulation, config.p2os).
Feel free to contribute scripts for other common configurations.
