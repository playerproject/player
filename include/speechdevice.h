 *   The speech device.  This one interfaces to the Festival speech
 *   synthesis system (see http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/).
 *   It runs Festival in server mode and feeds it text strings to say.
 *
 *   Takes variable length commands which are just ASCII strings to say.
 *   Shouldn't return any data, but returns a single dummy byte right now
 *   Accepts no configuration (for now)
