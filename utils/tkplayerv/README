--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
tkplayerv is a somewhat general graphical remote control client for Player
devices.  It allows you to subscribe to and visualize the data from a variety
of sensors, as well as send commands to a variety of actuators.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
tkplayerv is implemented in Tcl/Tk.  To use it, you need to have installed
relatively recent versions of Tcl and Tk, as well as TclX, because tkplayerv
uses UNIX-style signals for timing.

tkplayerv also depends on Tclplayer, a Tcl package that provides client
routines for interacting with Player servers.  Tclplayer is included (and
installed) with the Player distribution.  In order for Tcl to find Tclplayer,
your TCLLIBPATH environment variable must be set appropriately.  See
Section 2 of "Tclplayer Reference Manual" (also included with Player) for 
details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting tkplayerv
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
You start tkplayerv by executing 'viewer.tk' (if it's not currently executable, 
make it so now):

  $ ./viewer.tk -- [-h <host>] [-p <port>] [-s <size>]

Note that if you pass any arguments, you must precede them with a double-dash
(i.e., '--').  Unless <host> or <port> are specified, tkplayerv will connect
to a Player server on localhost:6665.  <size> is not exactly a general
size specifier, but it will allow you to make the GUI bigger or smaller.
As a hint, the default size is 400.

Using tkplayerv
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you've got it running, the GUI should be pretty self-explanatory.
Several checkbuttons allow to you turn on and off the display and control of
many common devices.  

The main canvas (the one that looks like a radar screen) displays laser, sonar,
laserbeacon, and bumper data, relative to the robot, which is pictured in the
center, facing upward along the positive Y-axis.

The upper-right canavs (with the cross-hairs) gives you control over the
robot's motors.  Click and hold (and possibly drag) to move the robot.  The
Y-axis is translational velocity and the X-axis is rotational velocity.  Note
that you may have to select "Activate Motors" to make a real robot move.

The middle-right canvas displays vision data by reconstructing the detected
color blob data from the robot's camera perspective.

The bottom-right set of widgets give you control of the PTZ camera.  The
arrows pan and tilt, and the + and - button zoom.
