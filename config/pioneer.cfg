# Desc: Configuration for a Pioneer robot and a SICK laser.
#       The p2os driver is used for all Pioneer robots. In addition to the position
#       interface, sonar, and power (battery voltage) interfaces, it also
#       provides interfaces for blobfinder via attached CMUcam, bumpers, and
#       gripper (these will return errors or no data if the requisite hardware
#       is not installed).
#       The SICK laser driver is seperate from the p2os driver.
