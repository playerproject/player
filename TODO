NEXT RELEASE:
-------------
- test multiple data packets per frame

- separate interface and driver docs

- add docs for new drivers

- decide which drivers are "stable" and which are "experimental"


NOW:
----
- add client pointers to all device interface calls

- Generalize gripper control to allow for any gripper, and modify command
    and data specifications to be more natural

LATER:
------

- P2OS stuff:
    - do error-checking on calls to:
        - CPacket::Build()
        - CPacket::Receive()
        - CPacket::Send()
        - others?
    - add capability to reconnect
        - but how?  symptom will be no SIP when one is expected.
          maybe set a timer to go off after 15ms and wake up
          the read, then do a Reconnect()?
             - tried that; still very flaky...
    + add position Reset.  DONE
    + remove calls to exit() from packet.cc
    + fix P2OSDevice::Setup() to not block waiting for SYNC0, thereby
        able to detect lack of P2OS.
    + failed startup occasionally, maybe especially on older 
      versions.  
        + hopefully fixed, because of tcflush().
        + much more robust startup now

LATENT:
-------

DONE:
------
+ add CDevice method to ask devices how many data packets are available for
  a particular client.

+ add some kind of config file to Player.   need to specify
    mappings from devices to ports and things like that.  still take
    command-line args, though.

+ test all configurable devices (esp. P2OS) with new request/reply method

+ Add context-sensitive support for thread creation

+ Create another device-table (or augment the current one), so as to remove
    as many device-specific #ifdef's from main.cc as possible.
       + no, use the existing DeviceTable.  just add some more stuff to it,
         like permissible access modes, string representation, etc., and maybe
         initialize the device pointer to NULL?

+ remove non-portable pthread behavior.  should be confined to:
      + pthread_kill_other_threads_np(). GONE
      + unlocking mutex owned by other thread.  GONE

+ add conditionals for connecting to 2-AT's.  should be easypeasyjapaneasy.

+ acts on old robots (tanis&milka) takes a LONG time to start up the
    first time (presumably before it's swapped in); Golem hangs.  wait
    longer?

+ update Java client?  nah, get the Danes to do it.

+ change all 'a', 'r', and 'w' to the appropriate PLAYER_*_MODE

+ 'finish' C client.  test (sim and robot).

+ rework C++ client. test (sim and robot).
     + add vision example (follow orange thing)

+ add #defines in messages.h that are plain text references for 
     devices, like for in arg parsing

+ make STX a short, instead of string "xX"

+ add method to get timestamp from devices
   - now, CLock::PutData() can take a timestamp, and it will
      store it in CDevice::data_timestamp.  Likewise, CLock::GetData()
      takes a pointer to put the timestamp into.

+ move repository to sagan/tobor

+ check on timestamps. make sure byte-swapping works (server and client).
    - defined macros htonll(x) && ntohll(x)

+ on tanis & v.0.6.5, one time only got 720 bytes from a laser
     data packet.  why?
       - now running client ON tanis.  maybe that fixes it?  that
           would be bad.
       - happened more than once.  data's not queuing up, though...

+ milka dead?
    - replaced fuse.
    - why did the fuse blow? blocked cooling fan?

+ change mailing list to 'players@fnord'

+ devicetable.cc: convert to 2-character codes.  need to dyanmically
                create/delete them. yuck.

+ add 'distro' target to Makefile.  should:
    + latex && cp golem.ps to ./doc
    + cd .. && tar hcvzf ..... 

+ figure out Boyoon's Golem-0.7/Arena-0.6.6 problem.
    - done.  was 'offsets.h' inconsistency.

+ document:
    + CRobot::ResetPosition()
    + 'z' device.
    + no commands to 'v' device.
    + 'xR' command.
    + talk about more robust P2OS control, mention direct wheel velocity...

+ change 'xr' to 'xr<val>' to switch between req/rep and cont

+ add ResetPosition() and ChangeVelocityMode() methods to CRobot class.

+ check out hanging on lack of PTZ device.  maybe do a test
   non-blocking read at first?
     - yep, and it worked

+ figure out direct wheel velocity control.  cuts down motor
    command packet count to one per cycle.  just try to send
    it every time; sometimes you block on the mutex because
    someone else is writing a config command or whatever; no big 
    deal.

+ RunPsosThread will now just call SendReceive() with the
    joint direct wheel velocity packet every run through.

+ eXpert commands now are implemented as calls to SendReceive()
    from the client_reader() thread.  not so bad, might block for
    a bit.

+ add private 'serial_mutex' to CP2OSDevice.  also public method
   'SendReceive(CPacket pkt)', which will lock on the mutex,
   send 'pkt', block on receive for a SIP, then return.

+ MUTEX ACCESS TO CLIENT SOCKET!  why didn't we do that before.  that
    HAS to be the reason for garbled responses to eXpert commands.
    what the hell was i thinking.
      - CClientData->socketwrite

+ PTZ device hangs after many commands. why?
    + also maybe it hangs Golem.  how?
    + glitches in the messaging.  seems to be fixed now.
        only have a problem after very stressful stop/restart

+ debug the loss of control problem.  see if it's the server
   or the client (hopefully the client).
     - maybe it was the server overloading P2OS.  put in checks
         so it only sends 'new' commands.  should cut down on serial
         line usage.
     - heavily cut down packet flow by removing unneeded GETAUX
         commands.  reinvestigate if we need PTZ feedback. seems
         solved now.

+ segfault when Control-C server sometimes.  leaves P2OS open and
    pinging.
      - problem was that client_writer threads were calling <device>.GetData()
          after <device> had been deleted, but before the main loop exited.
          solution was to keep track of CClientData pointers, and delete
          them one by one before deleting the devices.  nice shutdown
          behavior now.

+ after Control-C, says "Quitting", but then hangs sometimes.  especially 
    after laser startup error.  mutex locked somewhere, i guess.
      - can't reproduce on ant w/ no laser (v.0.5.1 8/18 BPG)
      - can't reproduce on tanis w/ no laser (v.0.6.5 8/18 BPG)

+ make read loop smarter in client_reader (main.cc).  should read 
    whole messages. 
      - added two-byte header and two-byte size specifier
          to device request messages.  makes read loop
          much better.  not to self: always include size
          in variable length messages...

+ when ACTS fails to start, server gives back error but does
    not shut down P2OS connection.
      - just had to Unsubscribe the positiondevice before returning
        on all Setup() failures.

+ robot.Request("pc",2) fails because the server never sends back a reply.
   should it?
     - yes.  adding 'c' permission descriptor. need to:
        - make sure shutdown is detected. DONE
        - make sure RemoveBlanks() works. DONE

+ camera: set it back to "normal" state on shutdown of vision device.
   DONE.

+ Java client:
  + ask esben how to layout .java files.
      + what about a Makefile?
      + how can source in examples/java load class from client_libs/java?

+ document MAXNUMTHREADS (8) and implications
