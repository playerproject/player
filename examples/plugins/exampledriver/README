Here's a very simple example of how to write a driver and build it as a
shared object.    For details on how to handle configuration requests, get
commands, push out data, etc., consult the User Manual.

To build this example, edit the Makefile according to where you've got the
Player source tree laid out and then type 'make'.

To try it, run:

  $ player -d ./exampledriver.so example.cfg
