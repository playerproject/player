Building
--------

The example can be built by making a directory (anywhere on your system where
you have write permissions will do), changing to that directory and executing
CMake with the example's source directory as an argument. For example, if you
have installed Player into /usr/local, you could do the following:

$ cd ~
$ mkdir exampledriver
$ cd exampledriver
$ ccmake /usr/local/share/player/examples/plugins/exampledriver/

Use the configure option (press 'c' in the Linux ncurses-based UI, for example)
until the generate option becomes available, then use that (press 'g' in the
ncurses UI). Then use the standard method of compiling for your environment to
compile (on Linux, this will probably be GNU Makefiles, so type 'make').

Running
-------

The example creates a shared library (libexampledriver.so on Unix-based
systems), which is loaded by the server using the example.cfg configuration
file. Copy this to the directory where you built the example and execute the
Player server:

$ player example.cfg
