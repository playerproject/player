Here's a very simple example of how to write a driver that supports
multiple interfaces (also builds as a loadable object).  For details
on how to handle configuration requests, get commands, push out data,
etc., consult the User Manual.

To build this example, edit the Makefile according to where you've got
the Player installed and then type 'make'.

To try it, run:

  $ player multidriver.cfg
