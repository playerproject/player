Here's a very simple example of how to write a plugin interface. This example
uses several other aspects of player, including configuration files, a
libplayerc client program and a plugin driver. For details on creating and using

Player installed and then type 'make'.

To try it, run (in separate terminals):

  $ player example.cfg
  $ ./example_client
