/*
 * This file contains the function table used to tell Player how to serialise
 * your interface messages.
 * The format is as follows:
 *
 * {interface code, message type, message subtype,
 *  pack function, deep copy function, clean up function}
 *
 * Note that a deep copy function and a clean up function are only necessary if
 * the structure used for that message contains dynamically allocated arrays. If
 * they are not needed, specify NULL instead.
 *
 * The XDR functions specified in this table must be linked as a part of the
 * interface library. They can be written by hand, but it may be easier to use
 * the playerxdrgen.py script in PLAYER_SRC/libplayerxdr. For example:
 *
 * python ../../../libplayerxdr/playerxdrgen.py -distro eginterf.h eginterf_xdr.c eginterf_xdr.h
 *
 * The files generated by this script will probably need some cleaning up,
 * especially the header file.
 *
 * The other part of the file is the function that will be exported in the
 * dynamically shared library and imported by the Player server. This must
 * return a pointer to the function table. Clients can link the library at
 * compile time and access the table directly in their call to
 * playerc_add_xdr_ftable(). However, if using multiple plugin interfaces in
 * a client, ensure that they don't use the same name for their function table.
