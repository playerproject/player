Building
--------

The example can be built by making a directory (anywhere on your system where
you have write permissions will do), changing to that directory and executing
CMake with the example's source directory as an argument. For example, if you
have installed Player into /usr/local, you could do the following:

$ cd ~
$ mkdir opaque_example
$ cd opaque_example
$ ccmake /usr/local/share/player/examples/plugins/opaque_example/

Use the configure option (press 'c' in the Linux ncurses-based UI, for example)
until the generate option becomes available, then use that (press 'g' in the
ncurses UI). Then use the standard method of compiling for your environment to
compile (on Linux, this will probably be GNU Makefiles, so type 'make').

Running
-------

This example creates a plugin driver shared library (libopaquedriver.so on
Unix-based systems), which is loaded by the server using the opaque.cfg
configuration file. Copy this to the directory where you built the example and
execute the Player server:

$ player opaque.cfg

The example also creates a client to match the driver, called "opaque". This
client will connect to the Player server, subscribe to the plugin driver and
test the interface. Execute it in a separate terminal from the server:

$ ./opaque
