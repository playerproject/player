Building
--------

The examples can be built by making a directory (anywhere on your system where
you have write permissions will do), changing to that directory and executing
CMake with the examples' source directory as an argument. For example, if you
have installed Player into /usr/local, you could do the following:

$ cd ~
$ mkdir libplayerc++_example
$ cd libplayerc++_example
$ ccmake /usr/local/share/player/examples/libplayerc++

Use the configure option (press 'c' in the Linux ncurses-based UI, for example)
until the generate option becomes available, then use that (press 'g' in the
ncurses UI). Then use the standard method of compiling for your environment to
compile (on Linux, this will probably be GNU Makefiles, so type 'make').

example for its author and license terms.

Running
-------

The examples each require that a Player server providing the necessary devices
is running. These are:

camera:             camera
clientgraphics:     graphics2d
clientgraphics3d:   graphics3d
example0:           position2d, sonar
example1:           camera
example2:           camera
example3:           camera
example4:           ir, position2d
goto:               position2d, sonar
grip:               gripper
laserobstacleavoid: laser, position2d
ptz:                camera, ptz
randomwalk:         laser or sonar, position2d
sonarobstacleavoid: position2d, sonar
speech:             speech
speech_cpp_client:  speech_recognition
wallfollow:         laser, position2d

For example0, goto, laserobstacleavoid, randomwalk, sonarobstacleavoid and
wallfollow, the simple.cfg configuration sample provided with Stage will
suffice.
