Building
--------

The examples can be built by making a directory (anywhere on your system where
you have write permissions will do), changing to that directory and executing
CMake with the examples' source directory as an argument. For example, if you
have installed Player into /usr/local, you could do the following:

$ cd ~
$ mkdir libplayerc_example
$ cd libplayerc_example
$ ccmake /usr/local/share/player/examples/libplayerc

Use the configure option (press 'c' in the Linux ncurses-based UI, for example)
until the generate option becomes available, then use that (press 'g' in the
ncurses UI). Then use the standard method of compiling for your environment to
compile (on Linux, this will probably be GNU Makefiles, so type 'make').

Running
-------

The examples each require that a Player server providing the necessary devices
is running. These are:

simple:             position2d
vmap:               laser
service_discovery:  vectormap
speed_c_client:     speech

For simple and vmap, the simple.cfg configuration sample provided with stage
will suffice.
