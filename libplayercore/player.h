NOTE: These configs are currently supported only by the Stage fiducial
driver (stg_fidicial), but are intended to be a general interface for
addressable, peer-to-peer messaging.

The fiducial sensor can attempt to send a message to a target using the
PLAYER_FIDUCIAL_SEND_MSG request. If target_id is -1, the message is
broadcast to all targets. The device replies with an ACK if the message
was sent OK, but receipt by the target is not guaranteed. The intensity
field sets a transmit power in device-dependent units. If the consume flag
is set, the message is transmitted just once. If it is unset, the message
may transmitted repeatedly (at device-dependent intervals, if at all).

Send a PLAYER_FIDUCIAL_RECV_MSG request to obtain the last message
recieved from the indicated target. If the consume flag is set,
the message is deleted from the device's buffer, if unset, the same
message can be retreived multiple times until a new message arrives. The
power field indicates the intensity of the recieved messag, again in
device-dependent units.

Similarly, the PLAYER_FIDUCIAL_EXCHANGE_MSG request sends a message,
then returns the most recently received message. Depending on the device
and the situation, this could be a reflection of the sent message, a
reply from the target of the sent message, or a message received from

 data to the client. @b Write access means that the client has permission
 to control the actuators of the device. There is no locking mechanism so
 different clients can have concurrent write access to the same actuators.
 @b All access is both of the above and finally @b close means that
 there is no longer any access to the device. Device request messages can

 that need different devices depending on the task at hand.  

 Of course, not all of the access codes are applicable to all devices;

 a request for such access will not generate an error; rather, it will be

not use an important password as your key, nor should you rely on
Player authentication to prevent bad guys from driving your robots (use
a firewall instead).  Rather, authentication was introduced into Player
to prevent accidentally connecting one's client program to someone else's
robot.  This kind of accident occurs primarily when Stage is running in
a multi-user environment.  In this case it is very likely that there
is a Player server listening on port 6665, and clients will generally
connect to that port by default, unless a specific option is given.

The @ref player_driver_p2os driver offers two modes of velocity control:
separate translational and rotational control and direct wheel control.
When in the separate mode, the robot's microcontroller internally
computes left and right wheel velocities based on the currently commanded
translational and rotational velocities and then attenuates these values
to match a nice predefined acceleration profile.  When in the direct
mode, the microcontroller simply passes on the current left and right
wheel velocities.  Essentially, the separate mode offers smoother but
slower (lower acceleration) control, and the direct mode offers faster
but jerkier (higher acceleration) control.  Player's default is to use
the direct mode.  Set @a mode to zero for direct control and non-zero
for separate control.

For the @ref player_driver_reb driver, 0 is direct velocity control,
1 is for velocity-based heading PD controller.
