Querying driver capabilities.

All drivers will respond to the universal request subtype, PLAYER_CAPABILTIES_REQ.

This request takes a data structure that defines the message type and subtype of the
capability you wish to query. The driver will respond with a NACK if the capability
is not supported and an ACK if it is.

The HANDLE_CAPABILITY_REQUEST macro (from driver.h) can be used to make this process
simpler, an example call would be something like this at the start of ProcessMessage

HANDLE_CAPABILITY_REQUEST (position_id, resp_queue, hdr, data, PLAYER_MSGTYPE_REQ, PLAYER_CAPABILTIES_REQ);
HANDLE_CAPABILITY_REQUEST (position_id, resp_queue, hdr, data, PLAYER_MSGTYPE_CMD, PLAYER_POSITION2D_CMD_VEL);

/**
@ingroup libplayercore
@defgroup interfaces Interface specifications

All Player communication occurs through <i>interfaces</i>, which specify
the syntax and semantics for a set of messages. See the tutorial @ref
tutorial_devices for a discussion of what an interface is.

Below are the details.  For each interface, the following is given:
- Relevant constants (size limits, etc.)
- %Message subtypes:
  - Data subtypes : codes for each kind of data message defined by the interface
  - Command subtypes : codes for each kind of command message define by
  the interfce.
  - Request/reply subtypes: codes for each kind of request/reply message
  defined by the interface.  Also specified are the interaction semantics,
  such as when to send a null request and when to expect a null response.
  A "null" request or response is a zero-length message.
- Utility structures : structures that appear inside messages.
- %Message structures:
  - Data message structures : data messages that can be published via
  this interface.
  - Command message structures : command messages that can be sent to
  this interface.
  - Request/reply message structures : request messages that can be sent
  to this interface and reply messages that can be expected from it.

It can be the case that a given message can be sent as data or in response
to a request.  A common example is geometry.  For many devices geometry
is fixed and so need only be requested once.  For others geometry may
change dynamically and so the device will publish it periodically.

@todo
  - Normalize subtype names (PLAYER_PTZ_REQ_GEOM vs PLAYER_POSITION2D_REQ_GET_GEOM)
