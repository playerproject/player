 server will start sending data from the specified device. For instance, if
 read access is obtained for the sonar device Player will start sending sonar
 data to the client. @b Write access means that the client has permission
 to control the actuators of the device. There is no locking mechanism so
 different clients can have concurrent write access to the same actuators.
 @b All access is both of the above and finally @b close means that
 there is no longer any access to the device. Device request messages can
 be sent at any time, providing on the fly reconfiguration for clients
 that need different devices depending on the task at hand.

 Of course, not all of the access codes are applicable to all devices;
 for instance it does not make sense to write to the sonars.   However,
 a request for such access will not generate an error; rather, it will be
 granted, but any commands actually sent to that device will be ignored.

a firewall instead).  Rather, authentication was introduced into Player
to prevent accidentally connecting one's client program to someone else's

The @ref player_driver_p2os driver offers two modes of velocity control:
separate translational and rotational control and direct wheel control.
When in the separate mode, the robot's microcontroller internally
computes left and right wheel velocities based on the currently commanded
translational and rotational velocities and then attenuates these values
to match a nice predefined acceleration profile.  When in the direct
mode, the microcontroller simply passes on the current left and right
wheel velocities.  Essentially, the separate mode offers smoother but
slower (lower acceleration) control, and the direct mode offers faster
but jerkier (higher acceleration) control.  Player's default is to use
the direct mode.  Set @a mode to zero for direct control and non-zero
for separate control.

For the @ref player_driver_reb driver, 0 is direct velocity control,
1 is for velocity-based heading PD controller.
