/**
@brief Base class for drivers which oeprate with a thread.

This class manages driver subscriptions, threads, and data
marshalling to/from device interfaces.  All drivers inherit from
this class, and most will overload the MainSetup(), MainQuit() and
Main() methods.

The ThreadedDriver uses a fairly simple thread model with the only complications
coming from the deferred cancellation.

The default setup method simply calls StartThread and likewise the default Shutdown method calls
StopThread. Resources for the driver should be allocated in MainSetup and cleaned up in MainQuit, these
two methods will be called in the driver thread before and after the main method respectively.

When StopThread is called it will request the driver thread to be cancelled, this cancellation will be
deffered until one of three cancellation points, ProcessMessages, Wait or TestCancel. In this way the driver
has control over when the thread is cancelled.

If a new subscription arrives before the thread has terminated then upon completion of the MainQuit method the thread
will be relaunched and MainSetup run. In this way it is gaurunteed that there is only ever one thread running for
the driver and that Main is always proceeded by MainSetup and followed by MainQuit before any new threads are launched.

To manage the thread lifetime a small state machine is implemented, containing four states: STOPPED, RUNNING, STOPPING
and RESTARTING. Initially the thread is in STOPPED state.

From the STOPPED state the only valid transition is to RUNNING, this is triggered by a call to StartThread.

From the RUNNING state the driver can transition to STOPPING, triggered by a call to StopThread.

In the STOPPING state the driver can transition to STOPPED, triggered by MainQuit running, or to RESTARTING on a call to
StartThread.

From RESTARTING the driver can transition to RUNNING once MainQuit has run and the new thread is started, or to STOPPING if
StopThread is called before the original thread terminates.
