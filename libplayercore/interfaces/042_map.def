 * @brief Access maps

The @p map interface provides access to maps.  Depending on the underlying
driver, the map may be provided as an occupancy grid, or as a set of
segments (or both).  In either case, the map is retrieved by request only.
Segment (aka vector) maps are delivered in one message, whereas grid
maps are delivered in tiles, via a sequence of requests.
