 * @brief Client - client communication.

@deprecated Most of the functionality of this interface can be achieved through the @ref
interface_opaque interface.

The @p mcom interface is designed for exchanging information between
clients.  A client sends a message of a given "type" and "channel". This
device stores adds the message to that channel's stack.  A second client
can then request data of a given "type" and "channel".  Push, Pop,
Read, and Clear operations are defined, but their semantics can vary,
based on the stack discipline of the underlying driver.  For example,
the @ref driver_lifomcom driver enforces a last-in-first-out stack.

@todo Is this interface used and/or needed any more?
