/** @brief Reference-counted message objects

All Player messages are transferred between drivers as pointers to Message
objects.  These objects are reference-counted so that messages can be
delivered to multiple recipients with minimal memory overhead.

Messages are not usually manipulated directly in driver code.  The details
of allocating, filling, parsing, and deleting Message objects are handled
by the Driver and MessageQueue classes.

The only method of interest to driver authors is the helper MatchMessage(),
which can be used in a Driver::ProcessMessage method to determine if a
message header matches a given signature.

/** @brief A doubly-linked queue of messages.

Player Message objects are delivered by being pushed on and popped off
queues of this type.  Importantly, every driver has one, Driver::InQueue.
All messages sent to the driver arrive on this queue.  However, the driver
rarely pops messages off its queue directly; instead the driver calls
Driver::ProcessMessages, which hands off each incoming message to
Driver::ProcessMessage (which the driver has presumably re-implemented).

Every queue has a maximum length that is determined when it is created; for
drivers this happens in the constructor Driver::Driver.  This length
determines the maximum number of messages that can be pushed onto the
queue.  Since messages vary greatly in size, there is not a direct
correspondence between the length of a queue and the memory that it
occupies.  Furthermore, since messages are reference counted and may be
shared across multiple queues, it is not necessarily meaningful to consider
how much memory a given queue "occupies."

The queue supports configurable message replacement.  This functionality is
useful when, for example, a driver wants new incoming commands to overwrite
old ones, rather than to have them queue up.  To decide whether an incoming
message should replace an existing message that has the same address
(host:robot:interface:index), type, and subtype, the following logic is
applied:

- If a matching replacement rule was set via AddReplaceRule(), that rule is
  followed.
- Else:
  - If the message type is PLAYER_MSGTYPE_REQ, PLAYER_MSGTYPE_RESP_ACK, or
    PLAYER_MSGTYPE_RESP_NACK, the message is not replaced.
  - Else:
    - If MessageQueue::Replace is false (it is set in the constructor and
      can be changed via SetReplace()), the message is not replaced.
    - Else:
      - The message is replaced.

Most drivers can simply choose true or false in their constructors (this
setting is passed on to the MessageQueue constructor).  However, drivers
that support multiple interfaces may use AddReplaceRule() to establish
different replacement rules for messages that arrive for different
interfaces.  For example, the @ref driver_p2os driver has incoming commands
to the wheelmotors overwrite each other, but queues up commands to the
manipulator arm.

The queue also supports filtering based on device address.  After
SetFilter() is called, Pop() will only return messages that match the given
filter.  Use ClearFilter() to return to normal operation.  This filter is
not usually manipulated directly in driver code; it's main use inside
Device::Request.
