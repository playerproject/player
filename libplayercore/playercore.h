/** @defgroup libplayercore libplayercore
@{
This C++ library defines the device driver API, the message queues used to
move messages between devices, facilities for parsing configuration files
and for loading and instantiating drivers.

The core components of this library are:

- player.h : Defines all message formats.

- Driver : All drivers inherit from this class, and must implement certain
methods.

- Device : An instantiated driver (i.e., a driver bound to an interface) is
a device and can be accessed via a pointer of this type.  Use this class
to, for example, subscribe to a device.

- ConfigFile : Use this class to parse a configuration file

- Message : All messages are of this type

- MessageQueue : Messages are delivered on queues of this type, and every
  driver has one (Driver::InQueue).

- error.h : Error-reporting and debug output facilities.  Don't call
  directly into the stdio library (printf, puts, etc.).  Instead use the
  macros defined in error.h, so that message verbosity can be centrally
  controlled and so that all messsages get logged to .player.
