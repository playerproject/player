 * One PlayerClient object is used to control each connection to
 * a Player server.  Contained within this object are methods for changing the
 * connection parameters and obtaining access to devices.
 *
 * Since the threading functionality of the PlayerClient is built on Boost,
 * these options are conditionally available based on the Boost threading
 * library being present on the system.  The StartThread() and StopThread() are
 * the only functions conditionally available based on this.
