/** @brief The client proxy base class
 *
 * Base class for all proxy devices. Access to a device is provided by a
 * device-specific proxy class.  These classes all inherit from the @p
 * ClientProxy class which defines an interface for device proxies.  As such,
 * a few methods are common to all devices and we explain them here.
 *
 * Since the ConnectReadSignal() and DisconnectReadSignal() member functions
 * are based on the Boost signals library, they are conditionally available
 * depending on Boost's presence in the system.  See the @em configure script
 * for more information.
