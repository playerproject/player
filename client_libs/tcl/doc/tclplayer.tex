\section{Introduction}
Tclplayer is a Tcl package that provides procedures and data structures for
interacting with the Player robot device server.  Tclplayer has no special
requirements and should work with any recent ``vanilla'' version of Tcl.

Although Tcl is not an object-oriented language (and because {\tt [incr
Tcl]} is horrific), Tclplayer is built around the idea of an ``object'' that
holds information about your client's connection to the server.  Each of the
Tclplayer procedures takes as its first argument a variable that holds this
information.  This object is initialized by calling {\tt player\_connect}
(see Section~\ref{sect:player-connect}).  

Though the object is sometimes treated as an opaque structure, you will
often index into it directly (it is implemented as an array).  In general, you
can access device-specific data by referring to:
\begin{verbatim}
    $object($device,$index,$variable)
\end{verbatim}
where {\tt device} is the string name of the device, {\tt index} is the integer
index of the device, and {\tt variable} is the name of some device-specific
quantity of interest.  For convenience, data for the $0^{th}$ instance of 
each device (if it exists) is replicated without an index, e.g.:
\begin{verbatim}
    $object($device,$variable)
\end{verbatim}
Thus when accessing data from the $0^{th}$ instance of a device (a very
common thing to do), you may either use the index or leave it out.  In the
exposition on device details given below, we leave out the index for clarity.
Also, most Tclplayer procedures optionally take an index; if unspecified, the
index is assumed to be 0.

By the way, most of the Tclplayer procedures can throw Tcl errors.  This can
happen, for example, if a socket read fails.  If you want to handle these
errors yourself (instead of letting the program exit), you should {\tt catch} 
return values from Tclplayer procedures.

\section{Importing the code}
The Tcl client utilities are implemented as a standard Tcl package, named
Tclplayer.  In order to use it, you should set your {\tt TCLLIBPATH}
to include the directory above the directory in which the Tcl client code
resides.  For example, if you install Player in your home directory (as is
the default), you might do:
\begin{verbatim}
    $ export TCLLIBPATH=$TCLLIBPATH:$HOME/player-1.2/lib
\end{verbatim}
Then you can import the package in your own script as per normal:
\begin{verbatim}
    package require Tclplayer
\end{verbatim}

\section{Generic functionality}
In this section we describe the device-neutral procedures provided by
Tclplayer.  Note that some procedures, notably {\tt player\_req} and {\tt
player\_write}, are not intended for user-level invocation, but rather should
be wrapped by device-specific procedures that provide friendlier interfaces.

\subsection{Connecting to the server}
\label{sect:player-connect}
In order to establish a connection to a Player server, you should call {\tt
player\_connect}:
\begin{verbatim}
    player_connect [-reqrep] obj [host] [port]
\end{verbatim}
Arguments are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt [-reqrep]} : if specified, your connection will be placed into a
request / reply data mode
\item {\tt obj} : this variable will become the ``object'' that you will use
to control this connection
\item {\tt [host]} : if specified, a connection will be made to Player
listening on this host (default is {\tt "localhost"})
\item {\tt [port]} : if specified, a connection will be made to Player
listening on this port (default is {\tt \DEFAULTPORT})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Disconnecting from the server}
To disconnect from the server, call {\tt player\_disconnect}, passing in the
connection-specific object:
\begin{verbatim}
    player_disconnect obj
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Making requests}
An arbitrary configuration request may be made by calling {\tt player\_req}:
\begin{verbatim}
    player_req obj device index req
\end{verbatim}
Arguments are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt obj} : the object for this connection
\item {\tt device} : the string name of the device to which the request is
made
\item {\tt index} : the integer index of the device to which the request is
made
\item {\tt req} : the (likely binary) string that is the request itself
\end{itemize}
This procedure will wait for the reply (discarding data received in the
meantime) and return the reply body.

\subsection{Requesting device access}
To simplify the common task of subscribing to (an unsubscribing from) devices,
a helper procedure {\tt player\_req\_dev} is provided:
\begin{verbatim}
    player_req_dev obj device access [index]
\end{verbatim}
Arguments are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt device} : the string name of the device being accessed
\item {\tt access} : the requested access mode (should be {\tt r}, {\tt w},
{\tt a}, or {\tt c})
\item {\tt [index]} : if specified, the index of the device being accessed
(default is 0)
\end{itemize}
This procedure returns the access mode that was granted by the server ({\tt e}
indicates an error).

\subsection{Reading data}
To read one round of data (in a blocking fashion), call {\tt player\_read}:
\begin{verbatim}
    player_read obj
\end{verbatim}
Any new data will be stored in {\tt obj}.  Tclplayer keeps track of whether
your connection is continuous or request/reply, and {\tt player\_read} will
behave accordingly (e.g., by sending a request for data when necessary).

\subsection{Writing data}
To write a message to the server, call {\tt player\_write}:
\begin{verbatim}
    player_write obj device index str
\end{verbatim}
Arguments are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt device} : the device for which the command is intended
\item {\tt index} : the index of said device
\item {\tt str} : the (likely binary) string that is the command itself
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Authentication}
If you are using Player's authentication facilities, then you can
request authentication for your client by calling {\tt player\_authenticate},
passing in the appropriate authentication key:
\begin{verbatim}
    player_authenticate obj key
\end{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
where {\tt fv} and {\tt tv} are forward and turn velocities, respectively.

For convenience, you can stop the robot (i.e., command zero velocities)
by the calling:

                        resolution intensity [index]
\end{verbatim}
where the arguments have the same meaning as they do in the data, as described
in the previous section.
