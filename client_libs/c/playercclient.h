/** @defgroup player_clientlib_c C client library

Included with Player is a simple, no-frills client interface library
written in ANSI C (@p client_libs/c).  This client is intentionally
primitive and most users will find it inconvenient for writing anything
more that the simplest control program.  Rather than direct use, the C
client should be considered the reference implementation of a Player
client library and should be consulted for networking details when
writing new clients in other languages (the C client can also be used
directly as a low-level substrate for other clients; the C++ client is
implemented in this way).  In the file @p playercclient.c are defined
the 5 device-neutral functions necessary in any client.
