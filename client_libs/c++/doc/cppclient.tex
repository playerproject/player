\chapter{Overview}

The C++ client ({\tt client\_libs/c++}) is generally the 
most comprehensive library, since it
is used to test new features as they are implemented in the server.
It is also the most widely used client library and thus the best 
debugged.  Having said that, this client is not perfect, but should
be straightforward to use by anyone familiar with C++.

The C++ library is built on a "service proxy" model in which the client
maintains local objects that are proxies for remote services.  There are
two kinds of proxies: the special server proxy {\tt PlayerClient} and the
various device-specific proxies.  Each kind of proxy is implemented as
a separate class.  The user first creates a {\tt PlayerClient} proxy and 
uses it to establish a connection to a Player server.  Next, the proxies
of the appropriate device-specific types are created and initialized
using the existing {\tt PlayerClient} proxy.
To make this process concrete, consider the following simple example 
(for clarity, we omit some error-checking):

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
  int main(int argc, char **argv)
  { 
    /* Connect to Player server on "localhost" at default port */
    PlayerClient robot("localhost");
    /* Request access to the ptz camera */
    PtzProxy zp(&robot,0,'a');

    int dir = 1;
    for(;;)
    {
      if(robot.Read())
        exit(1);
  
      // print out current camera state
      zp.Print();
  
      if(zp.pan > 80 || zp.pan < -80)
        dir = -dir;
  
      zp.SetCam(zp.pan + dir * 5,zp.tilt,zp.zoom);
    }

    // won't actually get here, but...
    robot.Disconnect();
  }
\end{verbatim}
}

This program will continuously pan the pan-tilt-zoom camera unit left and
right\footnote{Well, not exactly.  A little extra code is required to handle
the physical camera because it pans rather slowly; see 
{\tt examples/c++/ptz.cc} for the details.}.  First, a {\tt PlayerClient}
proxy is created, using the default constructor to connect to the
server listening at {\tt localhost:\DEFAULTPORT}.  Next, a {\tt PtzProxy} is 
created to control the camera.  The constructor
for this object uses the existing {\tt PlayerClient} proxy to establish
"all" ({\tt 'a'}) access to the 0th pan-tilt-zoom camera.  Finally, we enter
a simple loop that reads the current camera state and writes back a new 
state with the pan angle changed slightly.

With that simple example in mind, we now describe the full functionality of 
the C++ client library.

\section{The {\tt PlayerClient} Class}
One {\tt PlayerClient} object is used to control each connection to a Player
server.  Contained within this object are methods for changing the connection 
parameters and obtaining access to devices, which we explain next.

\subsection{Constructors}
The {\tt PlayerClient} class has three different constructors:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt PlayerClient()} : Create a {\tt PlayerClient} proxy but do not 
                                  to a server.
\item {\tt PlayerClient(char* hostname)} : Create a {\tt PlayerClient} proxy 
and (if {\tt hostname} is non-NULL) connect it to a server listening at
{\tt hostname}:\DEFAULTPORT.
\item {\tt PlayerClient(char* hostname,int port)} : Create a 
{\tt PlayerClient} proxy and (if {\tt hostname} is non-NULL) connect it to 
a server listening at {\tt hostname}:{\tt port}.
\end{itemize}
Note that the second and third forms will attempt to make a connection, which
may fail for any number of reasons.  The constructor cannot indicate the 
success or failure of the connection, so to be sure you should either: use
the form and then call {\tt Connect()} yourself or use the second or third
form and then call {\tt Connected()} to verify that you are indeed 
connected (see below for information on both methods).

\subsection{Connecting to the Server}
If you have a {\tt PlayerClient} proxy that is not currently connected to
a server, you can connect it with any of the three forms of the method
{\tt Connect()}:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt int Connect()} : Connect to the server listening at
{\tt localhost}:\DEFAULTPORT.
\item {\tt int Connect(char* hostname)} : Connect to the server
listening at {\tt hostname}:\DEFAULTPORT.
\item {\tt int Connect(char* hostname, int port)} : Connect to the server
listening at {\tt hostname}:{\tt port}.
\end{itemize}

These methods return 0 if the connection succeeded. If something
went wrong, then -1 is returned, the connection is {\sl not} established,
and a diagnostic error is printed to {\tt stderr}.

\subsection{Disconnecting from the Server}
If you have a {\tt PlayerClient} proxy that is currently connected to
a server, you can disconnect it with the method:

{\tt int Disconnect()}

\noindent If the disconnection succeeded 0 is returned.  
Otherwise -1 is returned (the connection was probably already closed).

\subsection{Verifying Connection}
In order to check whether or not your {\tt PlayerClient} proxy is currently
connected, use the method:

{\tt bool Connected()}

\subsection{Reading Data}
After your {\tt PlayerClient} proxy is connected and you have requested
some devices (see below), you can read data with the method:

{\tt int Read()}

\noindent This method will read one round of data; that is, it will read
one data packet for each device that is currently open for reading.  The
data from each device will be processed by the appropriate device proxy
and stored there for access by your program.  If no errors occurred 0
is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is returned and diagnostic information is printed
to {\tt stderr} (you should probably close the connection!).

\subsection{Changing Data Delivery Frequency}
You can change the rate at which your client receives data from the 
server with the method:

{\tt int SetFrequency(unsigned short freq)}

\noindent The value of {\tt freq} is interpreted as Hz; this will be the
new rate at which your client receives data (when in continuous mode).
On error, -1 is returned; otherwise 0.

\subsection{Changing Data Delivery Mode}
You can toggle the mode in which the server sends data to your client with
the method:

{\tt int SetDataMode(unsigned char mode)}

\noindent The {\tt mode} should be either 1 (for request/reply) or 0 (for
continuous).  On error, -1 is returned; otherwise 0.

\subsection{Requesting Data}
When in request/reply mode, you can request a single round of data using
the method:

{\tt int RequestData()}

\noindent On error -1 is returned; otherwise 0.

\section{The Device Proxy Classes}
Access to a device is provided by a device-specific proxy class.  These
classes all inherit from the {\tt ClientProxy} class which defines an
interface for device proxies.  As such, a few methods are common to all
devices and we explain them here.

The constructors for the various proxies all take the same forms:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt DeviceProxy(PlayerClient* pc, unsigned short index)} : Create
    device proxy but do not request access to the device.
\item {\tt DeviceProxy(PlayerClient* pc, unsigned short index, 
    unsigned char access)} : Create device proxy and request {\tt access}
    access to it (should be {\tt r}, {\tt w}, or {\tt a}).
\end{itemize}
The pointer {\tt pc} must refer to an already connected 
{\tt PlayerClient} proxy.  The {\tt index} indicates which one of the
devices to use (usually 0).  Note that the request executed by the second
form of the constructor can fail, but the constructor cannot indicate the
failure.  Thus, if you use the second form, you should verify that the
current access is identical to your requested access using the method:

{\tt unsigned char GetAccess()}

\noindent  An access of {\tt e} indicates that some device-related error 
occurred (e.g., the device could not be initialized due to a hardware problem).

If you use the first form of the constructor to create a device proxy with 
no access, you can request access using the method {\tt ChangeAccess()}, 
which takes two forms:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt int ChangeAccess(unsigned char req\_access)}
\item {\tt int ChangeAccess(unsigned char req\_access, unsigned char* 
        grant\_access)}
\end{itemize}
In the second case, the actual granted access is returned in 
{\tt grant\_access}.  In either case, 0 is returned if all went well
and -1 is returned if a low-level (i.e., not device-related) error 
occurred.  In addition to requesting initial device access, this method
can be used at any time to request a change of access to a device.

Most device proxy classes also provide a method for printing out their
current state:

{\tt void Print()}

\noindent  This method prints to {\tt stdout} device-specific data
in a format that (hopefully) lends itself to automatic processing and
plotting.
