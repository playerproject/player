libplayerc is a client library for the Player robot device server.  It
is written in C to maximize portability, and in the expectation that
users will write bindings for other languages (such as Python and
Java) against this library; @ref player_clientlib_libplayerc_py "Python bindings" are
already available.

@section libplayerc_usage General usage

libplayerc is based on a device <i>proxy</i> model, in which the client
maintains a local proxy for each of the devices on the remote server.
Thus, for example, one can create local proxies for the <tt>position</tt>
and <tt>laser</tt> devices.  There is also a special <tt>client</tt> proxy,
used to control the Player server itself.

Programs using libplayerc will generally have the following structure:

@include simpleclient.c.doc

This example can be built using the commands:
<PRE>
$ gcc -c simple.c -o simple.o
$ gcc -lm -lplayerc simple.o -o simple
</PRE>

Make sure that <tt>playerc.h</tt> is installed somewhere in you
include path, and that <tt>libplayerc.a</tt> is in your library path.

<P>
The above program can be broken into six steps, as follows.

<ul>

<li> Create and connect a client proxy.

<P>
<PRE>
client = playerc_client_create(NULL, "localhost", 6665);
playerc_client_connect(client);
</PRE>
The <TT>create</TT> function creates a new client proxy and returns a
pointer to be used in future function calls (<TT>localhost</TT> should be
replaced with the network host name of the robot).  The <TT>connect</TT>
function notifies the Player server that a new client wishes to
recieve data.


<li> Create and subscribe a device proxy.

<P>
<PRE>
position = playerc_position_create(client, 0);
playerc_position_subscribe(position, PLAYER_ALL_MODE);
</PRE>
The <TT>create</TT> function creates a new position device proxy and
returns a pointer to be used in future function calls.  The <TT>subscribe</TT> function notifies the Player server that the client is
using the position device, and that the client expects to both send
commands and recieve data (<TT>PLAYER_MODE_ALL</TT>).

<li> Configure the device, send commands.

<P>
<PRE>
playerc_position_enable(position, 1);
playerc_position_set_speed(position, 0, 0, 0.1);
</PRE>
The <TT>enable</TT> function sends a configuration request to the server,
changing the robot's motor state from <TT>off</TT> to <TT>on</TT>, thereby
allowing the robot to move.  The <TT>setspeed</TT> function sends a new
motor speed, in this case commanding the robot to turn on the spot.


<P>
Note that most Player devices will accept both asynchronous
<EM>command</EM> and synchronous <EM>configuration</EM> requests.
Sending commands is analogous using the standard Unix <TT>write</TT>
device interface, while sending configuration requests is analogous to
using the <TT>ioctl</TT> interface.  For the most part,
<TT>libplayerc</TT> hides the distinction between these two
interfaces.  Users should be aware, however, that while commands are
always handled promptly by the server, configuration requests may take
significant time to complete.  If possible, configuration requests
should therefore be restricted to the initialization phase of the
program.


<li> Read data from the device.

<P>
<PRE>
playerc_client_read(client);
printf("position : %f %f %f\n", position-&gt;px, ... );
</PRE>
The <TT>read</TT> function blocks until new data arrives from the Player
server.  This data may be from one of the subscribed devices, or it
may be from the server itself (which sends regular synchronization
messages to all of its clients).  The <TT>read</TT> function inspects the
incoming data and automatically updates the elements in the
appropriate device proxy.  This function also returns a pointer to the
proxy that was updated, so that user programs may, if desired, trigger
appropriate events on the arrival of different kinds of data.


<li> Unsubscribe and destroy the device proxy.

<P>
<PRE>
playerc_position_unsubscribe(position);
playerc_position_destroy(position);
</PRE>
The <TT>unsubscribe</TT> function tells the Player server that the client
is no longer using this device.  The <TT>destroy</TT> function then frees
the memory associated with the device proxy; the <TT>device</TT> pointer
is now invalid and should be not be re-used.


<li> Disconnect and destroy the client proxy.

<P>
<PRE>
playerc_client_disconnect(client);
playerc_client_destroy(client);
</PRE>
The <TT>disconnect</TT> function tells the server that the client is
shutting down.  The <TT>destroy</TT> function then frees the memory
associated with the client proxy; the <TT>client</TT> pointer is now
invalid and should be not be re-used.

</ul>
