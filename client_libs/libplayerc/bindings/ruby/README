These are the Ruby bindings for Player (part of the PlayerStage project).
http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/

THIS BINDINGS WILL NOT BE COMPILED BY DEFAULT!

If you want to install this bindings edit the CMakeList file on 
$PLAYER_SOURCES_ROOT/client_libs/libplayerc/bindings/CMakefile.txt


This is a work in progress, examples in examples/  
show what is hopefully working so far. 

The ruby examples connect to a local Player running in the default port. 
Start Player before running any examples.
The examples will access underlying hardware so either you have Player running in the real robotic hardware
or read Player documentation to run Player with the Stage or Gazebo simulators. 

For instance, laser.rb can be run with Player and Gazebo as follows:

gazebo worlds/pioneer2dx.cfg
player GAZEBO_ROOT/player-cfgs/gazebo.cfg
ruby test.rb laser

Gazebo provides of an environment with an specific robot and laser (defined in pioneer2dx.cfg)
Player connects to gazebo and provides of robot and laser generic interfaces (defined in gazebo.cfg)
laser.rb controls a generic robot with a generic laser
