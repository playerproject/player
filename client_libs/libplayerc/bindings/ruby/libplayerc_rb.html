    @brief A Ruby client library for the @ref util_player

    libplayerc_rb is a SWIG-generated Ruby interface to @ref
    player_clientlib_libplayerc.  You can guess the Ruby API by a little
    mental translation of the symbol names in the C API.
        
    THIS BINDINGS WILL NOT BE COMPILED BY DEFAULT! (they are WIP)

    If you want to compile and install this bindings edit the CMakeList file on 
    $PLAYER_SOURCES_ROOT/client_libs/libplayerc/bindings/CMakeLists.txt
    adding:
    ADD_SUBDIRECTORY (ruby)
    and configure/make/install player

    If the bindings were installed correctly can be tested with:
    ruby examples/test_bindings_installation.rb


    Some examples in examples/ show what is hopefully working so far. 
    The ruby examples connect to a local Player running in the default port. 
    Start Player before running any examples.
    The examples will access underlying hardware so either you have Player running in the real robotic hardware
    or read Player documentation to run Player with the Stage or Gazebo simulators. 

    For instance, laser.rb can be run with Player and Gazebo as follows:

    gazebo worlds/pioneer2dx.cfg
    player GAZEBO_ROOT/player-cfgs/gazebo.cfg
    ruby test.rb laser

    Gazebo provides of an environment with an specific robot and laser (defined in pioneer2dx.cfg)
    Player connects to gazebo and provides of robot and laser generic interfaces (defined in gazebo.cfg)
    laser.rb controls a generic robot with a generic laser



    @todo Document this library properly.
