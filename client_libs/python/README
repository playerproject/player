------------------------

Contents

./examples/python/Makefile              - the makefile


Test environments
-------------------
The codes have been tested using python version 1.5.2 and 2.0. The
newest version of player (Player-Bleeding.tar.gz) was used.


Requirements
----------------
PlayerClient module is pure python codes, so it requires no additional
module or package.

'viewer.py' imports 'Tkinter' modules for GUI. It might also require
the newest version of Player (i.g. Player-Bleeding.tar.gz) because
it invokes 'playerclient.set_laser_config()', which does not supported
in Player-pre1.0.


Known bugs
--------------
Audio device is not supported yet.
Broadcast device is not supported yet.
